               <title>History</title>
               <p>Campbell was born in 1869 when Joseph Campbell, a fruit merchant, and Abraham Anderson, an icebox manufacturer, jointly set up the business. They called the concern the Joseph A. Campbell Preserve Company, which later came to be known as the Campbell Soup Company. Initially, it sold canned tomatoes, vegetables, jellies, soups, condiments, and mincemeat; the first ready-to-eat tomato soup was introduced in 1897, long after Joseph Campbell had retired.</p>
               <p>Condensed soup was the brainchild of John T. Dorrance, a chemist at the company. Dorrance created five varieties of ready-to-eat soups, including tomato, which has gained something of an iconic status and continues to be one of the top-ten shelf-stable foods sold in U.S. grocery stores. By 1911, Campbell’s soups, which had become immensely popularity, were being sold all over the United States.</p>
               <p>Growth at Campbell came about both due to the growth in sales of its product lines and also through acquisitions. In 1915, Campbell acquired the Franco-American Food Company, its first acquisition.</p>
               <p>In 1961, Campbell acquired Pepperidge Farm, maker of dinner rolls, stuffing, oatmeal breads, and European-style cookies—as well as whole-wheat bread, which contained only natural ingredients.</p>
               <p>The 1990s were a period of major acquisitions, notably the purchases of Arnott’s Limited of Australia, a large biscuit manufacturer; Pace Foods, a leading producer of Mexican sauces; Erasco Group, Germany’s leading canned soup company; Liebig, the leading wet soup brand in France; and Fortun Foods, makers of Stock Pot soup, a market leader in premium refrigerated soups.</p>
               <p>In 2009, Campbell bought Ecce Panis, a premium-quality artisan breadmaker. Then in 2012, in a $1.55 billion deal for fresh foods and a line of juices, protein shakes, smoothies, and café beverages, it acquired Bolthouse Farms, a market leader in growing and distributing.</p>
               <p>In 2013, Campbell acquired Plum Organics, a Taplow, UK-based maker of premium organic foods for children, toddlers, and babies. In the same year, Campbell also acquired the Kelsen Group, a maker of quality-baked snacks, including the Kjeldsens and Royal Dansk brands that are sold in eighty-five countries.</p>
               <p>Campbell acquired the pretzel and chip company Snyder's-Lance, whose brands inlcude Kettle Chips, Snyder's of Hanover, Cape Cod, and Pop Secret, for $4.9 billion in 2017. This was part of Campbell's plan to expand further into the fast-growing market for savory snacks while placing less focus on canned soup, as soup sales had declined. That year they also acquired Pacific Foods of Oregon, a manufacturer of organic canned soups and other prepared meals.</p>

                                   xlink:type="simple">Advertising</related-article> has played a key role in the success of Campbell since the company’s beginnings. The Campbell Soup Kids were first featured in Campbell advertisements in 1905, and they became wildly popular with the public over the decades that followed. The Campbell Kids were drawn by Grace Drayton, a staff artist for the <italic>Philadelphia Press and Evening Journal</italic>. She drew as many as sixteen of the kids for the company.</p>
               <p>Campbell was among the first companies to use people in advertising. Even as the advertisements evolved over time, the Campbell Kids continued to connect consumers with Campbell. Campbell Kids dolls and collectibles are very much in demand, and some are even valuable.</p>

Acting on the results of the company’s study, Campbell in 2010 rolled out a new label and packaging, expecting a 2 percent increase in sales in 2012. However, experts have raised questions about the efficacy of neuromarketing and the ethics of such marketing techniques.</p>
               <p>In 1962, artist <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The silkscreens have become iconic pieces of pop art; one in particular, <italic>Small Torn Campbell Soup Can (Pepper Pot)</italic> (1962), commanded a price of $11.8 million at an auction in 2006.</p>
               <p>On January 7, 2016, Campbell Soup announced that it would "support mandatory national labeling of products that may contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs)." With this move, Campbell became the first major food company to back mandatory labeling for foods containing <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"
                                   xlink:href="89158200"
                                   xlink:type="simple">GMO ingredients</related-article>. Like the most of the food industry, Campbell had for years prior to the announcement opposed mandatory labeling of foods for GMOs.</p>
               <p>In March 2012, Campbell announced that it would phase out the use of the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in its can linings. Groups that opposed the use of BPA in food packaging cited lab studies that seemed to show that exposure to BPA in the linings of metal food cans had been linked to a number of health conditions, including type-2 diabetes, infertility, and early puberty in girls. However, the U.S. <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"
                                   xlink:href="89312413"
                                   xlink:type="simple">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</related-article> has said that the "available information continued to support the safety of BPA for the currently approved uses in food containers and packaging."</p>
               <p>Campbell faced criticism in some quarters for siding with the motivated groups that opposed the use of BPA and for doing so despite the weight of the scientific evidence that demonstrated its safety. In addition, at the time of Campbell's announcement, no replacement for BPA had been discovered that could be used in cans holding acidic foods, like Campbell's signature tomato soup. Thus, while Campbell, like many other companies, has been phasing out the use of BPA in low-acid canned foods, critics argued that its statement misleadingly implied that the company would be doing so for all of its foods, which was not yet possible.</p>
