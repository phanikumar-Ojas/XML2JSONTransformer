               <p>In addition to producing films, Universal Studios owns four globally acclaimed amusement parks.

Included in these franchises are Universal’s Jurassic Park and Despicable Me as well as Warner Bros.’s Harry Potter film series and Disney’s Marvel superheroes. In this industry, Walt Disney is Universal Studios’ most significant competitor.</p>
               <p>In the years after one of Universal’s largest expansions in 2010, Universal’s amusement parks became direct competitors with Walt Disney in terms of rising attendance and profits. While the company produces and releases multiple films annually, it also actively develops its four amusement parks, with the water theme park Volcano Bay added to Universal Orlando in 2017.</p>

               <title>History</title>
               <p>Universal Studios was originally founded as the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912 by <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   xlink:type="simple"

                                   xlink:href="88829427">Carl Laemmle</related-article>. By the time he created Universal, Laemmle had already owned an independent theater in Chicago, Illinois, and shortly after had started the Independent Moving Picture Company of America (IMP). Together with the New York Motion Picture Company, Rex Motion Pictures, and Powers Motion Pictures, Universal originated in New York, New York.</p>
               <p>After Laemmle was named president, Universal spread its influence to California, later establishing headquarters in the San Fernando Valley. In 1915, Universal City in the San Fernando Valley became the headquarters of Universal, and the studio became the first to encompass all parts of the filmmaking process. Universal was originally known for its silent westerns and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   xlink:type="simple"

                                   xlink:href="87322626">horror films</related-article>. Because they were silent, Laemmle began the Universal Studio Tour, which allowed the general public to view the studios during filming. But when silent films were replaced by traditional motion pictures, the public was no longer invited due to fear of ruining the audio of new films.</p>
               <p>Laemmle retired from his position in the mid-1930s, leaving Universal up for sale. In what would become a trend for the company, Universal was bought by another company, and the partnership ushered in a new era of films. Standard Capital Company purchased Universal in 1936, just as comedic duo <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In 1946, International Pictures and Universal came together to form Universal-International. Under the new name, the company released dramas over comedies such as the Academy Award–winning <italic>

               <p>Universal was purchased by Decca Records in 1952 and was purchased again by the Music Corporation of America (MCA) in 1958, under whose influence such films as <italic>Spartacus</italic> (1960) and <italic>To Kill a Mockingbird</italic> (1962) were released. MCA and Universal came together in 1962 to form MCA Universal, eventually leading to the diversification of the film company into the music and amusement industries throughout the mid- to late-1900s.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the success of <italic>Spartacus</italic> and <italic>To Kill a Mockingbird</italic>, Universal reopened the Universal Studio Tour in 1964, which gradually became the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park.

               <p>In 1999, Universal Studios Florida was renamed Universal Orlando Resort with the addition of a new park, Islands of Adventure. Following the success of the American amusement parks, Universal Studios Japan opened in 2001. Universal Studios enjoyed success from both its films and amusement parks, eventually merging with NBC in 2004 to form NBCUniversal. This partnership further diversified the company into the radio, television, and news industries. It also led to the development of Universal’s brand of animated films in partnership with Chris Meledandri, a former executive of Universal’s competitor, 20th Century Fox. The collaboration resulted in the <italic>Despicable Me</italic> (2010) film and franchise.</p>
               <p>In 2010, Universal bought the theme park rights for the Harry Potter franchise and added the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. This addition raised park attendance by 30 percent and subsequently lowered Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom’s attendance by 1.5 percent that same year. After the success of the expansion, Comcast purchased NBCUniversal in 2011. Similar expansions were made at Universal Studios Japan in 2014 and Universal Studios Hollywood in 2016 to similar attendance increases.</p>
               <p>In the summer of 2016, NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation, the family entertainment studio responsible for such popular franchises as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. Not long after that announcement, the company revealed plans to open a new Dreamworks Theatre attraction at its Universal Studios Hollywood location in 2018. Designed to be an immersive visual experience, the first iteration will revolve around Kung Fu Panda.</p>

               <title>Impact</title>
               <p>Universal Studios has produced award-winning films and world-renowned amusement parks for more than a century. To keep up with its competitors, the company continued to expand upon its properties through the revamping of past franchises and the introduction of sequels to create new franchises. The interconnectedness of Universal’s film and amusement park branches ensured the longevity of the company alongside its main competitor, Walt Disney. With Universal’s continued collaboration with animation companies and various franchises, the company was in direct competition with Walt Disney’s similar efforts in expansion and franchise purchase.</p>
