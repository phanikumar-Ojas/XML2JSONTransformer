                                   xlink:type="simple">National Broadcasting Company (NBC)</related-article> used episodes of <italic>Forensic Files</italic> as a summer replacement series in 2002—the first time an original cable show had been aired on a broadcast network during its cable run. By 2007, the series was attracting more than a million viewers each week to Court TV and had become the cable network’s top-rated show. It also was airing—under various titles, including <italic>Forensic Files</italic> and <italic>Medical Detectives</italic>—in more than 140 countries worldwide.</p>
               <p>Although at least one previous television crime series, <italic>Quincy, M.E</italic>. (1976-1983), had developed some interest in the forensic sciences among the public, that show was fictional and focused primarily on the main character, a medical examiner, rather than on scientific principles. In contrast, <italic>Forensic Files</italic> was among the first to examine forensic procedures in a documentary television format, and it became a catalyst for the development of popular fictional drama series featuring forensics, such as <italic>CSI: <xref ref-type="glossary" id="forensics.gloss.1067">crime scene</xref> Investigation</italic> and its spin-offs.</p>
               <p>
                  <italic>Forensic Files</italic> is produced by Medstar Television in association with Court TV Original Productions. Medstar produces health-related materials for a variety of private and public forums, including the Discovery Channel, the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Paul Dowling, the show’s executive producer and cofounder of Medstar Television, has been quoted as noting that the premise of <italic>Forensic Files</italic> is to demonstrate that science can “beat the bad guys.” A spin-off program called <italic>Forensic Files Advanced</italic> was launched in 2006 that provides additional information on previously aired cases in the form of pop-ups.</p>

               <title>Format</title>
               <p>In each episode, <italic>Forensic Files</italic> focuses on a single criminal case—often a murder—and demonstrates how forensic procedures were used to solve the crime. The material is presented typically in the form of a chronology of events, from initial investigation through court or other legal resolution. Cases are culled from a variety of sources, including magazine and newspaper stories and suggestions from scientists and investigators, and are usually selected based on their intrigue value.</p>
               <p>The show primarily follows an interview format, with commentaries from various parties on the case at hand, including family members of victims, detectives, anthropologists, journalists, medical examiners, and criminologists. Although the show is billed as a documentary and the episodes generally depict relatively little action, the producers use music, reenactments of actual events, computer animation, and other dramatic devices to give the series the ambiance of a crime mystery. The crime reenactments are typically shot in a different videographic style and frequently depict alternate explanations of the crime that are eventually disproved. Most of the cases presented do not involve high-profile crimes, but they often contain bizarre elements that enhance the show’s “whodunit” aspects.</p>
               <p>Although <italic>Forensic Files</italic> often highlights cases currently in the news, many of the crimes examined on the show were initially considered “cold cases”—cases that had long gone unsolved—until newer forensic technologies were used to crack them. In fact, forensic advances are often a key plot element in the program, and occasional hour-long <italic>Forensic Files</italic> specials are aired that focus on high-profile investigations such as the 1932 abduction and murder of the son of famed aviator <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In addition, the show often focuses on cases in which persons who had been convicted of crimes were eventually exonerated thanks to cutting-edge forensic techniques. Criminal investigations are the primary fare of <italic>Forensic Files</italic>, but the program occasionally explores other realms of forensic investigation, including accidents, civil cases, suicides, and mysterious health issues, such as Legionnaires’ disease and outbreaks of disease caused by hantaviruses.</p>

For example, the show rarely focuses on <xref ref-type="glossary" id="forensics.gloss.1089">DNA</xref> (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis and other techniques that have become part of the mainstream lexicon but are sparingly employed in real life. Such procedures are often extremely costly, and results may not be available for months, as many forensics laboratories are seriously overburdened.

               <p>Although <italic>Forensic Files</italic> depicts more of the gritty reality of forensic investigation than do fictional dramas such as <italic>CSI</italic>, some critics have argued that, like other crime shows, it creates an overly glamorous picture of forensic work. Critics have also asserted that <italic>Forensic Files</italic> serves to bolster the false assumption that <xref ref-type="glossary" id="forensics.gloss.1125">forensic science</xref> is infallible, as it fails to acknowledge the true limitations of the science.
