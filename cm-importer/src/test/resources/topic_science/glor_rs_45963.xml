               <title>Variety of Rangelands</title>
               <p>Rangelands are extensive and extremely variable. As defined by the Society for Range Management, they occupy approximately 50 percent of the world’s total land surface and about 500 million hectares in the United States alone. Rangelands are home to countless nomadic herders on nearly every continent. They vary from high-elevation alpine tundra and high-latitude Arctic tundra to tropical grasslands. The tall grass prairies in the United States (now mostly plowed for intensive agriculture) and the rich grasslands of eastern Africa are among the most productive. Rangelands grade into woodlands and forest as woody species and trees become more abundant. Some forests are grazed by wild and domestic animals, and the distinction between rangeland and forest is often not clear. The other difficult distinction is between rangeland and pastureland. Pastureland is generally improved by seeding, fertilization, or <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"

                                   xlink:type="simple">irrigation</related-article>, whereas rangelands support native plants and have little intensive improvement.</p>
               <p>In the United States, rangeland improvements during the twenty years after <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

After the 1970’s, when fuel costs increased and environmental concerns over <xref ref-type="glossary" id="glor.gloss.1155">pesticide</xref> use increased, brush control practices were reduced considerably. Modern environmental concerns include rangeland degradation from livestock grazing, especially on riparian vegetation along streams, endangered animal and plant species. These issues have become controversial in the United States.</p>

However, energy is degraded at each step along the way and cannot be used again. Energy is transferred but not cycled. Grazing animals on rangelands influence plants by removing living tissue, by trampling, and by altering competitive relations with other plants. Large grazing animals tend to compact the soil and reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff. Plants furnish all the nutrients obtained by herbivores and eventually by carnivores and omnivores as well.</p>

               <title>Rangeland Dynamics</title>
               <p>Rangelands vary considerably with time; they are not static. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of some factors related to rangeland change over time. Pollen records and, in the southwestern United States, packrat middens have been used to reconstruct past <xref ref-type="glossary" id="glor.gloss.1038">climate</xref> and vegetational changes. Some areas have become drier and others more mesic. Formation and retreat of <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

A recent general trend in many rangelands of the world is an increase in woody plants at the expense of grasses. Many factors are probably responsible for these shifts, but fire control, excessive livestock grazing, climatic shifts, introduction of exotic species, and the influence of native animals are likely causal agents.</p>
               <p>Rangelands are threatened by encroachment from crop agriculture as human populations increase. Nomadic herders traditionally dealt with periodic <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In modern society, with reductions of area available for livestock grazing and restrictions for political reasons, herders are often forced to maintain higher livestock numbers to support their growing families and others directly dependent on livestock. Despite various kinds of disturbances and stresses on rangelands, these areas have supported many large grazing animals and people for centuries. They are resilient and will likely be sustained for many more centuries to come.
