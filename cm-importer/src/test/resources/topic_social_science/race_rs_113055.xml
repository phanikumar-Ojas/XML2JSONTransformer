               <p>While monotheism, messianism, and other fundamental tenets of their faith remained intact, adherents of Judaism gradually broke with the passivity that had marked Jewry throughout the Middle Ages, rejecting its self-perception as a people patiently awaiting redemption from their suffering in exile among the Gentiles, who persecuted them for their beliefs or, worse, expelled or destroyed them in pogroms (anti-Jewish massacres).</p>
               <p>While the insularity that marked Jewish communities in the diaspora<index-term>

                  </index-term> never completely vanished, from the end of the eighteenth century on there was a greater trend toward cultural assimilation, especially in North America and industrialized Europe. By the nineteenth century, in most European nations emancipated Jews could study at universities and enter such professions as medicine and law, long prohibited to them. It was a considerable step forward: Through much of their history, in their dealings with Christians, European Jews had been limited to such activities as itinerant trading and usury (money lending). </p>

               <p>Discrimination against Jews in the diaspora has continued despite the fact that in most industrialized nations its legal sanctions have been removed for almost two centuries. This discrimination partly results from the fact that residual discrimination against ethnic minorities tends to outlive legalized or institutionalized discrimination, even when there are statutory safeguards against it. Anti-Jewish discrimination is compounded by the fact that it has evolved from both anti-Judaism and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>Anti-Judaism first arose in antiquity, in both polytheistic paganism and Pauline Christology. According to many scholars, the earliest Christians, themselves Semites, had to compete with Jews in efforts to win new converts to their separatist faith. At the time, the Hebrews were militant and zealous proselytizers who dared to defy even the Romans, as their unyielding mass suicide at Masada in 73 <sc>c.e.</sc> testifies.</p>

Their ethnocentrism led to terrible suspicions—that, for example, they desecrated the host, sacrificed Christian children (the notorious “<related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Some Jews, notably moneylenders, were despised for other reasons, but the official sanctions against them were usually imposed on more theological than ethnic grounds. In some Islamic areas, notably in Spain, the Sephardic Jews, considered “people of the book,” were often treated much better, and some even rose to great political prominence. It was there, under the Arab sponsorship of arts and letters, that they produced the Golden Age of Hebrew Literature (c. 1000–1150 <sc>c.e.</sc>).</p>

For their distinct self-identity, they were forced to pay a terrible price.

                  </index-term> Many disillusioned Jews had already turned to Zionism, believing that their only hope lay in the creation of a nation of their own in Palestine, their ancestral home. Some Jews did place their hopes on radical sociopolitical change, including socialism and communism, but most rejected the atheism at the core of Marxism. Modern Zionism was actually a rekindling of beliefs that had been suppressed in the Enlightenment and Emancipation, centering on the idea that someday, under the providential guidance of Jehovah, the Jews would return from exile, restored to their rightful nation-home. It would take its vigorous secular and militant “back to Jerusalem” form after the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

By the end of the nineteenth century, liberal Jews who had sought an end to Jewish-Christian conflict had their hopes dashed in eastern Europe, especially Russia, where the Orthodox Church aided and abetted the pogroms and disseminated the spurious <italic>

Despairing of ever reconciling their Jewish culture to the non-Jewish religions and cultures of their host nations, Jews in eastern Europe either hunkered down in their segregated tradition, emigrated, or sought solutions in Zionism. Zionism also attracted radical antireligious Jews and socialistic Jews whose Zionism was purely secular in vision.</p>

While most European Christians stood by silently and watched without protest, Hitler vilified the Jews. They were an easy scapegoat, especially in the romantic anti-intellectualism that characterized the Nazi vision of the world. When he came to power, Hitler began a systematic campaign of persecution that, during World War II, culminated in the “final solution”—the genocidal extermination of Jews. Jews were rounded up throughout the conquered nations of Europe and North Africa and sent to extermination camps, where more than six million were put to death.</p>
               <p>The Holocaust severely reduced the number of Jews in Europe, which, until the war, had been the center of Jewish culture and tradition in the diaspora. In effect, it severed the ties of many emigrant Jews to their past, obliterating such important Jewish cultural enclaves as the Warsaw ghetto. It also resulted in a major demographic shift, moving the centers of contemporary Judaism away from Europe to the United States and Israel.</p>

               <title>Aftermath of the Holocaust</title>
               <p>In the Holocaust the Jews experienced the greatest single calamity in their history, surpassing even their loss of sovereignty over Palestine with the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 <sc>c.e.</sc> The Nazi efforts to exterminate the Jews resulted in three major changes: the destruction of whole communities of diaspora Jews in Europe and North Africa, the disappearance of millennial Jewish settlements in Islamic countries in the Middle East, and the “ingathering” of exiled Jews in the nation-state of Israel.</p>
               <p>Although Israel was created in 1948 as a secular democracy, it fostered pride in Jews throughout the world, particularly in its succession of victories over the Islamic nations that had vowed to drive the Jews out of the Holy Land. Many liberal Jews who had neglected or even rejected their heritage before the Holocaust made a new commitment to it in the post-World War II years. They also won the sympathy of many Christians, who were shocked by the horror and dehumanizing impact of the Nazi policy. As Stephen Sharot notes in <italic>Judaism: A Sociology</italic> (1976), in the postwar “Western Diaspora there was a sharp decline of overt anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination.” Cultural and religious insularity, where it persists in the West, reflects choice rather than compulsion. The vestiges of anti-Semitism in the West are largely found in such settings as private clubs, where membership may exclude religious, ethnic, or racial minorities.<index-term>
