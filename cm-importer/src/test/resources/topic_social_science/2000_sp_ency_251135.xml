               <p>Notable iPhone features included a glass touch screen (most phones at the time had plastic screens), unprecedented support for multitouch interactions and gestures, aluminum backing, 2.0-megapixel camera, an accelerometer to adjust orientation, web browsing, visual voicemail, and a music player that integrated with <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The first iPhone offered GSM/EDGE cellular network access, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and Wi-Fi, and could initially be purchased with 4 or 8 gigabytes of memory for $499 or $599 respectively (a pricier 16-gigabyte model was added later). </p>

Apple arranged a revenue-sharing agreement with AT&amp;T for a cut of every customer’s monthly plan, and the iPhone’s popularity empowered cell phone manufacturers in negotiating deals with wireless carriers. The original iPhone was an immediate and sustained success. Consumers waited in long lines on release day, and the phone sold rapidly, moving nearly two million units by the end of 2007. By the fourth quarter of 2008, Apple was selling nearly seven million iPhones each quarter, and twenty-one million iPhones had been sold internationally by the end of 2009. </p>

The iPhone 3GS came out in June 2009, adding a compass, 3.2-megapixel video camera, and improved processing speeds. In 2010, the rectangular iPhone 4 was released followed by the iPhone 4s in 2011, which included new features such as the iCloud, iMessage, and intelligent personal assistant, Siri.</p>
               <p>Thinner and lighter than its predecessors, the iPhone 5 was released in 2012. The following year, Apple released the iPhone 5c, a replica of the well-received iPhone 5 but in a more colorful case. The iPhones 6 and 6s were released in 2015, featuring pressure-sensitive 3D Touch technology and an improved 12MP camera. The iPhone 7 was released in September 2016, along with the larger-format 7 Plus. These models included some new features, such as water resistance and the lack of a traditional 3.5 millimeter headphone jack. Some have criticized Apple for building “<related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Apple also drew criticism after several companies that manufactured iPhone components, most notably Foxconn in China, were investigated for deplorable working conditions.</p>
               <p>In late 2017, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were announced, offering relatively minor feature improvements. At the same time the iPhone X was announced, though it was released slightly later and in initially limited numbers. Promoted as the most radical update of the iPhone yet, the premium iPhone X included features such as a facial recognition system and wireless charging capability. It also pushed the iPhone to a new price point, debuting at $999.

That same year saw the launch of the iPhone XR, a model slightly less expensive than the Xs and Xs Max, that went on to become one of 2019's most popular and best-selling smartphones. Apple's 2019 iPhone generation products, the iPhone 11 and its Pro versions, were followed by 2020's iPhone 12 and 2021's iPhone 13 along with their respective mini and Pro versions. Throughout these generations, alterations and improvements largely centered around battery life, camera system advancements, and processing power. At the same time, some reviewers noted that Apple's upgrades had tended to become increasingly more incremental by that time, as was typically the case with other makers of smartphones.</p>
