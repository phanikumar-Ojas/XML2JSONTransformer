               <p>Virginia, the "Old Dominion," joined the Union on June 25, 1788, as the tenth state.

                  <bold>Native American Tribes:</bold> Virginia's early history is bound up with that of the American Indian tribes who met—and then fought—the European settlers.

Peace finally came when his daughter, Pocahontas, married colonist John Rolfe in 1614. This kept the peace until Powhatan's death in 1618.</p>
               <p>Over the next several decades, Powhatan's heirs fought several wars against the settlers. In 1644, the Virginian colonists defeated the American Indians decisively. The two sides fought again, however, in the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                  <bold>State and National Parks:</bold> Virginia's parks include many types of sites, such as scenic trails and other natural areas, Civil War battlefields, cemeteries, and the birthplaces of historic leaders. There are about forty state parks and natural areas, including Pocahontas State Park, near Richmond; Shenandoah River State Park; and Civil War battlefields at Staunton River and Sailor's Creek.</p>
               <p>There are twenty-two national parks, including Shenandoah National Park, in the Blue Ridge Mountains; Jamestown National Historic Site, the location of the first English colony in America; the Booker T. Washington National Monument, in Hardy; and Appomattox Court House National Historic Park.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Natural Resources:</bold> Virginia enjoys an abundance of natural resources, both agricultural and mineral. Virginia farmers grow tobacco, soybeans, hay, cotton, grains, and corn. Poultry, dairy, and beef farming are also important. The state's mineral resources include coal, stone, sand, and gravel. The waters of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed bring rich harvests of fish and shellfish, particularly crabs and oysters, to Virginia's commercial fishers.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Plants and Animals:</bold> Virginia is still a largely rural state, with nearly two-thirds of the land covered with forests. Common trees include oak, hickory, and pine. Travelers can see many varieties of wildflowers alongside the state's highways, including tulips. In the Tidewater region, marsh vegetation predominates in the southeastern wetlands; the Great Dismal Swamp, for example, is home to large cypress trees. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions are heavily forested.</p>
               <p>The coastal region is home to many varieties of wildlife, particularly shellfish. The lower Chesapeake Bay and the Tidewater estuaries are full of oysters, crabs, and other aquatic life. Despite human settlement, large mammals such as black bears and bobcats are still often found in the state's mountainous regions. On Assateague Island, near Virginia's Eastern Shore, bands of wild ponies wander freely. Legend says that the ponies swam ashore more than four hundred years ago to escape a Spanish shipwreck.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Climate:</bold> Virginia has a temperate climate, with long summers and short winters, except in the western mountains. The average January temperature is 36 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average temperature in July is 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The regions of the state receive between thirty-eight and forty-seven inches of rainfall each year; rainfall is particularly heavy in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions.</p>

                  <bold>Major Industries:</bold> Virginia, though heavily agricultural, also has a widely diversified industrial and service economy. Many residents, particularly in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, work for the federal government. This government presence includes many research facilities. The US Navy also provides much economic strength. Norfolk is home to a major naval base, and Portsmouth is home to a naval shipyard. Newport News is home to many commercial shipbuilders, including those that build the navy's nuclear aircraft carriers. The high-technology industry, especially telecommunications, and the aerospace industry are also strong areas.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Tourism:</bold> For many years, Virginia has promoted tourism with the slogan "Virginia Is for Lovers." Thousands of tourists visit the state each year to enjoy the natural beauty as well as the Old Dominion's historic past. In 2019, travelers spent an estimated $27 billion in the state, which generated about $1.8 billion in tax revenue, according to the state tourism corporation. Colonial Williamsburg, the former capital, is a popular destination, where restored eighteenth-century buildings and recreated handicrafts give a glimpse into eighteenth-century life. Richmond offers a rich cultural life, including theater, symphony orchestras, and professional sports. The capital also possesses several museums, including the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Charlottesville is home to Thomas Jefferson's residence, <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>
                  <bold>Agriculture:</bold> Virginia remains highly agricultural, despite the state's increasing industrialization. Though it is no longer the only nor the most lucrative cash crop, tobacco remains important to the economy. Cattle and poultry farming are important as well. Soybeans, corn, hay, wheat, tomatoes, peanuts, pumpkins, barley, and fruit are significant crops.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Airports:</bold> Because of its proximity to the nation's capital, Virginia is a major air-travel hub. The state has four international airports: Richmond International Airport, Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport, Norfolk International Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. There is also a major national airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, as well as a number of regional airports throughout the state, including those in Winchester, Staunton, South Hill, Roanoke, and Lynchburg.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Seaports:</bold> Virginia carries on a busy international trade through its general-cargo seaports: Norfolk International Terminals, Newport News Marine Terminal, Portsmouth Marine Terminal, the Virginia Inland Port, Virginia International Gateway, and Richmond Marine Terminal. The first four are owned by the Virginia Port Authority and operated by Virginia International Terminals, an affiliated company; the last two are owned privately and by the municipality, respectively. The Port Authority is an official state agency and reports to the secretary of transportation. The main commodities handled include coal, soybeans, wood pulp and fuel, and various manufactured products.</p>

                  <bold>Executive:</bold> The governor is the chief executive officer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The governor proposes legislation to the General Assembly, makes political appointments, and acts as commander in chief of the state military forces. The governor also heads the cabinet, which is made up of the heads of state administrative agencies and other top officials. Other state officers include the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, and the secretary of the commonwealth (similar to secretary of state). The lieutenant governor presides over the state senate but can vote only in the event of a tie. The lieutenant governor becomes governor in case the incumbent dies, resigns, is disqualified, or is removed from office.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Legislative:</bold> Virginia has a bicameral, or two-house, legislature called the Virginia General Assembly. The General Assembly dates back to the foundation of the colonial House of Burgesses in 1619 and consists of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia. The House of Delegates has one hundred members, while the Senate has forty members. All members are elected by voters in their respective districts. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve for four years. In addition to its lawmaking functions, the General Assembly approves the state budget, levies taxes, elects judges, and confirms the governor's political appointments.</p>
               <p>Other parts of the legislative branch include legislative commissions and the auditor of public accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <bold>Judicial:</bold> The Virginia court system includes the Supreme Court of Virginia, the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the circuit courts, and the district courts. There are general district courts, which handle a wide variety of cases, as well as specialized district courts for juveniles and domestic relations. The state supreme court has original and appellate jurisdiction, but it primarily serves as a court of review. It has seven justices, who are elected to twelve-year terms by majority vote of both houses of the legislature.</p>
