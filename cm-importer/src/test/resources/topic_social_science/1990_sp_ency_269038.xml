               <p>In April 1996, the National Basketball Association announced the formation of a new Women’s National Basketball Association, which would initially consist of eight teams in two conferences, playing in cities with existing NBA “partner” teams. The new league hoped to capitalize on the U.S. women’s basketball team’s undefeated gold medal run during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Several of the star Olympians, including Swoopes, Sheryl Sheryl Swoopes and Lobo, Rebecca Rebecca Lobo, signed on to the WNBA immediately, and the league’s first president, Ackerman, Val Val Ackerman, was named. The regular season ran from June to August, and in September 1997, the Houston Comets Houston Comets won the first of what would become four consecutive WNBA championships. Shortly thereafter, WNBA officials announced that four new teams would be added for the 1998 season, bringing the league total to twelve teams.

               <title>Impact</title>
               <p>As a relatively young league, the WNBA has struggled financially and its players do not receive salaries or lucrative product endorsements equivalent to those of professional male athletes, prompting some leading players to skip WNBA seasons in order to play for teams in other countries, which offer much higher salaries. Despite these challenges, the WNBA has persisted and has significantly increased the visibility of professional women’s sports. Its players have become role models for many American girls, and the league has helped to increase the popularity of basketball as a high school and college sport for female athletes. The league, which is the longest-running women’s professional basketball league in the United States, celebrated its twentieth season in 2016. <index-term>
