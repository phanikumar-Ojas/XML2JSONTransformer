            <bold>Education:</bold> Education is compulsory from age six to sixteen. Primary education begins at age six and lasts for six years. After secondary school, students may take one or two years of vocational training or a two-year college-preparatory course that leads to the Bachillerato degree.</p>
          <p>Education is free in public schools, which educate the majority of the students in Spain. Most private schools, run by the Catholic Church, also receive subsidies that allow them to offer tuition-free instruction.</p>
          <p>Spain is home to many universities with long-established histories. The Universidad Complutense de Madrid was founded in the thirteenth century by King Sancho IV of Castile. The University of Salamanca was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX of Leon.</p>

          <p>Spain has 4.44 doctors for every 1,000 people (2019), but the distribution of physicians is uneven. Large cities have the best hospitals and the most medical personnel. In other areas, especially the interior, patients may have to wait a long time to see a doctor.</p>

            <bold>Food:</bold> Spanish cooking uses a lot of olive oil and tomatoes. Many Spanish recipes have Arab influences, using typical Middle Eastern spices along with fruits or almonds in savory dishes.</p>
          <p>One favorite Spanish dish is tortillas, which are nothing like the Mexican flat bread that most Americans are used to. Instead, a Spanish tortilla is complex omelet made with potatoes. Another traditional dish is paella, a mixture of meats and shellfish with garlic, peas, onions, tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The name comes from the wide, shallow, two-handled pan that is used to cook and serve the dish.</p>
          <p>Other foods typically served in Spain include gazpacho (cold soup), lamb, pork, cheese, sardines, octopus, calamari (squid), and fruit.</p>
          <p>Tapas, small snacks or appetizers of typical Spanish food, are a prominent feature of Spanish dining. They are served in inexpensive restaurants called tapas bars.</p>
          <p>The national drink is wine. Spain is famous for sangria, a mixture of wine and fruit juice, and for jerez (sherry). Cocoa and thick, black coffee are also popular drinks. Carbonated water is called <italic>con gas</italic> (with gas), and plain water is called <italic>sin gas</italic> (without gas).</p>
          <p>
            <bold>Arts &amp; Entertainment:</bold> Because the heat can be intense, leisure activities in Spain often begin at sundown. Many businesses close as people rest during the hottest part of the day. This period is called siesta.</p>
          <p>The evening often begins with a paseo, a stroll through the streets. Streets in Spain are lively places, lined with busy sidewalk cafes and bars.</p>
