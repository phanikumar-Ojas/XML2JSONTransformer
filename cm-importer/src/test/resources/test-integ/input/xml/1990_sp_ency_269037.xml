                  </index-term>Bertelsmann is the largest book club operation in the world. In 1998, Bertelsmann’s Doubleday Direct (formerly the Doubleday One Dollar Book Club) acquired Newbridge Communications, renaming it Doubleday Select, Inc. In July of that year, Bertelsmann acquired Random House from Advance Publications, merging it with Bantam Doubleday Dell. Bertelsmann then represented the biggest trade publisher in the English-speaking world, with the United States becoming Bertelsmann’s most important market at the time. The US operations of Bertelsmann included the Literary Guild and Doubleday’s book and record clubs. By December, 1999, the media conglomerate planned to consolidate a partnership with Bertelsmann’s Literary Guild and the Book-of-the-Month Club unit of Time Inc.</p>
               <p>Bertelsmann maintained a substantial stake in the online book business. In 1995, the company, together with America Online (AOL), launched the online service AOL Europe. By 1999, Bertelsmann held a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.com. In the same year, Bertelsmann launched Bertelsmann Online (bol.com), the Internet book retailer.</p>

               <title>School Book Clubs</title>
               <p>School book clubs expanded dramatically in the 1990s, perhaps driven to some degree by pedagogic movements such as “whole language” or “literature-based” approaches to teaching and learning. These approaches focused on literature-rich learning environments, which conceivably offered major book clubs such as Scholastic, Trumpet, and Golden Book Club opportunities to grow and diversify. School book clubs continued to supply children with books and other materials throughout the 1990s but also began supplying classrooms with literacy materials in the form of trade books for elementary literacy programs. These book clubs also began supplying miscellaneous merchandise to children. Some of the most popular serialized school book club titles in the 1990s, such as those of the Baby-sitters Club, Sweet Valley High, and Boxcar Children mystery series, included miscellaneous merchandise such as stickers, posters, puzzles, stamps, pencils, activity sheets, <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Book clubs also supplied children with so-called activity books, such as Martin Handford’s <italic>Where’s Waldo?</italic> series, which challenged young readers to find characters rather than to read about them, while at the same time inviting readers to play games, solve puzzles, and crack brainteasers.</p>

               <title>Online Book Clubs</title>
               <p>With the arrival of the Internet also came the arrival of online book clubs. During the 2000s and the 2010s, online book clubs have transformed into online communities that discuss books—just like regular book clubs do. The difference between a book club and an online book club, however, is that online book club members do not meet physically. Some people feel hesitant about joining these online groups, fearing that they will lack the intimacy and spontaneity of in-person meetings. Readers cannot always make it to book club meetings, however, which makes the online option a more convenient one. Furthermore, online book clubs allow people to join a conversation when it is most convenient for them. And although these online communities plan their virtual meetings ahead of time, anyone can add a comment when they want and read at their own pace. Doing some research, one can find out what type of online book clubs exist out there and join. </p>
