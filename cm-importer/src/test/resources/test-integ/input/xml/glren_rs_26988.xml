          <p>In 1576, at the age of fourteen, she joined the traveling theatrical troupe, the Gelosi (Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi) and thus began her stage career. She was invited into the troupe by its director, Flaminio Scala, a nobleman, theatrical manager, and scenario writer. The Gelosi was a well-established theatrical company of professional actors who performed both fully scripted plays and <italic>commedia dell’arte</italic>
                   (comedy marked by a combination of improvisation and prepared scripts). <italic>Commedia dell’arte</italic> was popular for more than three centuries in <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

          <p>With the Gelosi, Isabella would play the lead female role of <italic>prima donna inamorata</italic> (romantic prima donna) or <italic>inamorata</italic> (woman beloved and in love.)

          <p>Isabella and Francesco often performed on stage together, with Francesco playing the leading male role of <italic>inamorato</italic> (man in love), and later, the role of the Spanish captain, Capitan Spavento.

          <p>She was also a published writer,

          <p>In 1601, Isabella was accepted as a member of the prestigious Accademia degli Intenti of Pavia. It was unusual for women to be accepted into academies, but her literary work earned her this great honor. Accesa became her pseudonym. Later that year, she published a collection of poems called <italic>Rime</italic>
                   (partial English translation, 1997), which included madrigals, eclogues, sonnets, and other poetic forms. She had also collected 148 fictional epistles or letters to be published under the title of <italic>Lettere</italic>
                  
(partial English translation, 1997). A French translation of <italic>Rime</italic> was published and received critical acclaim.</p>
          <p>In 1602, the Gelosi traveled in northern Italy. In 1603-1604, the troupe was in France performing for the court of Henry IV and Queen Marie de’ Medici, who praised Isabella’s acting. On their return trip, Andreini miscarried her eighth child and died in <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                             xlink:type="simple">Lyon, France</related-article>, on July 10, 1604. She was forty-two years old. In Lyon, there was a great public funeral, where she was deeply mourned by the public. A commemorative medallion was created and inscribed with the Latin words <italic>aeterna fama</italic> (eternal fame).</p>
          <p>Her grieving husband disbanded the Gelosi, retired from acting, and moved to Mantua, where he worked on editing and publishing Isabella’s remaining works. In 1605, he published <italic>Rime . . . Parte seconda</italic>
                  
(rime, part two). This book included poetry written by Isabella after 1600, poems written about her, and some pastoral poems, monologues, and dialogues from her comedies. In 1606, one of their sons, Giambattista Andreini, a prolific playwright, dedicated a collection of poems to his mother.</p>
          <p>In 1607, Francesco Andreini published Isabella’s <italic>Lettere</italic>. These fictional epistles were not dated nor did they indicate the place written or the addressee. They were reflections on various subjects, such as love and moral or social issues. The value of virtue and propriety, which characterized Isabella’s public image, was a pervasive theme of the epistles. The most famous is the eloquent defense of women called “Del nascimento della donna” (on the birth of women), addressed to a father who was disappointed that his newborn was a daughter and not a son.</p>

          <title>Significance</title>
          <p>Isabella Andreini was the most celebrated <italic>comica</italic> (dramatic actress) of her time. A great beauty who could speak and act in several languages, she was one of the greatest <italic>inamorati</italic> in the history of Italian comedy. She was the only female actor of the time to write and publish her own compositions.</p>
          <p>As both a famous actress and paragon of virtue, she showed that it was possible to have a family and to be successful as an actor. Such theatrical families became more common after Isabella’s time.</p>
