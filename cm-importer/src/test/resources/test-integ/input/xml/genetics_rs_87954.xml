                  </index-term> Replication of ColE1 plasmids requires an RNA preprimer, called RNA II, that interacts with the origin of <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1595">replication</xref> and forms a particular secondary structure. This allows an <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1260">enzyme</xref> to cut and form the mature <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1564">primer</xref> needed for DNA replication. Antisense RNA I can bind to RNA II, preventing the formation of the necessary structure. In the R1 plasmid, the CopA antisense RNA can bind and prevent the translation of the RNA transcript for replication initiation protein RepA. Thus, change in <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1541">plasmid</xref> number is controlled by changing levels of antisense RNA, modifying the ability of plasmids to replicate.</p>
               <p>Many <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                                   xlink:type="simple">plasmids</related-article> use antisense RNA to ensure their maintenance within bacteria. The R1 plasmid transcribes Hok toxin mRNA, but interaction with antisense Sok RNA prevents its translation. Sok RNA is less stable than Hok RNA, so plasmid loss leads to Sok degradation but leaves some Hok transcripts. These transcripts are translated into a toxin that kills the cell in an elegant mechanism of selection for plasmid propagation. Antisense regulation has also been found in association with transposons and bacteriophages.</p>
               <p>Bacteria use antisense RNA<index-term>
                     <primary>Bacteria</primary>
                     <secondary>antisense RNA</secondary>
                  </index-term> to regulate particular genes. Such RNA is often encoded in a region different from that of the target and may affect multiple genes. For example, the OxyS RNA, induced by oxidative stress, inhibits translation of fhlA mRNA, involved in formate metabolism. In conjunction with the protein Hfq, OxyS RNA binds near the ribosome-binding site in fhlA mRNA, preventing translation. MicF RNA is induced under cellular stress and binds to the mRNA of membrane pore protein ompF to prevent its translation.</p>
               <p>One of the first examples of antisense regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes came from the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Small antisense RNA molecules lin-4 and let-7 show imperfect base-pairing to the 3′ untranslated region of their target gene mRNAs. This results in translational inhibition and is important for normal development. These small antisense RNAs are members of the microRNA (miRNA)<index-term>

                  </index-term> class of small, single-stranded molecules found throughout eukaryotes. They are produced by cleavage of longer molecules containing partial self-complementarity that produces a hairpin structure.</p>
               <p>Antisense RNA has been implicated in other processes. Imprinted genes are often associated with antisense transcripts from the same locus, and double-stranded RNA may be capable of affecting DNA <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1155">chromatin</xref> structure through <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1450">methylation</xref> of <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1367">homologous</xref> sequences.</p>

               <p>The mechanism of RNA silencing by RNAi is present in a wide variety of eukaryotes (including mice and humans), and the steps involved are likely to be similar. The process begins with the recognition of a long double-stranded RNA molecule by the conserved <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1617">RNase</xref> III-type <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1257">endonuclease</xref> enzymes Drosha and Dicer, which cut the long RNA to produce a double-stranded RNA about twenty-two nucleotides long with overhanging 3′ ends). This molecule is unwound by the <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1343">helicase</xref> activity of Argonaute proteins recruited by Dicer. The mature, single-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA),<index-term>

                  </index-term> produced by these actions acts as a guide molecule for the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),<index-term>
                     <primary>RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)</primary>
                  </index-term> which contains multiple nucleases and uses the antisense strand of the siRNA to recognize complementary RNA sequences. These sequences are then either translationally repressed or cleaved and degraded. Some organisms, including plants, fungi, and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, use an RNA-dependent <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1616">RNA polymerase</xref> (RdRP) to amplify the siRNA signal by producing secondary siRNAs to be processed by Dicer. <italic>C. elegans</italic> and plants show evidence of a systemic response, whereby initial silencing in one cell spreads to other cells by transport of siRNA (occurring via phloem in plants).</p>
               <p>Several different types of RNAi, including siRNA and miRNA, have been discovered, and all take advantage of the properties of complementary antisense RNA by binding target RNA, particularly mRNA, via noncovalent base pairing. For siRNA, binding of target sequences is governed by a critical region in the siRNA sequence called the “seed region,” the ribonucleotides encompassing positions 2 through 7. It is this region that gives siRNA its target specificity and allows RISC to bind, leading to target cleavage or repression. While the seed region is important in target recognition, complementarity in other regions is critical for target cleavage.<index-term>

                  </index-term> One therapeutic approach involves the use of antisense RNA or RNAi. Antisense oligonucleotides containing CpG sequences, for example, have been shown to be immunostimulatory and have been studied in clinical trials for various cancers, asthma, and allergies, and as vaccine adjuvants. Their potential use in treating atopic eczema, ulcerative colitis, atrial fibrillation, atheroschlerosis, Crohn's disease, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy is under investigation.</p>

These genes, as well as mutated genes, can be targeted using antisense RNA to decrease expression of proteins encoded by these genes to prevent tumor growth. mRNA from a mutant allele may be targeted for degradation in a <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1357">heterozygous</xref> patient, allowing expression of the correct protein from only the <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1702">wild-type</xref> allele. Several RNAi molecules have been evaluated in clinical trials for cancer and other diseases. Antisense techniques are being studied for the targeting of viruses and prevention of their replication and could eventually be used to correct aberrant splicing of gene transcripts. Many of these potential uses have been successfully demonstrated in experimental systems, including <xref ref-type="glossary" id="genetics.gloss.1136">cell culture</xref> and mouse models.</p>
               <p>Many issues remain to be addressed before antisense RNA therapeutics are truly feasible. Effective delivery systems are needed to produce sustained effects in appropriate cell types. The systemic transport of RNAi in some organisms may facilitate therapeutic applications. The safety of such approaches remains to be established, but overall, therapeutic uses of antisense RNA are promising.</p>
