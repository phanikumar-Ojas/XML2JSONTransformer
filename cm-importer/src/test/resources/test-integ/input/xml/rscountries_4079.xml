               <p>Papua New Guinea is renowned for the abundant diversity of its indigenous cultures, languages, and animal life. There are more than eight hundred spoken dialects, and perhaps an even greater number of ethnic groups. Nearly two hundred species of <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88802575">mammals</related-article> have been discovered one the islands, and still much of the mountainous tropical terrain is unexplored.</p>

               <p>Papua New Guinea shares its western border with the Irian Jaya province of <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88391099">Indonesia</related-article>, its neighbor on the island of New Guinea. Hundreds of offshore islands, including the Bismarck Archipelago, Manus, Buka, Bougainville, the Louisiade Archipelago, and others, account for roughly 15 percent of the country’s total land area.</p>
               <p>The interior mainland of Papua New Guinea is dominated by the Bismarck, Victor Emanuel, and Owen Stanley mountain ranges. The porous <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88806515">limestone</related-article> rock absorbs rainwater, so there are no streams in this part of the country. The country’s highest point is at the peak of Mount Wilhelm, 4,509 meters (14,793 feet) above <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88953059">sea level</related-article>.</p>
               <p>Between the mountain ranges are the highland valleys, where most of the population is concentrated. The southern region is characterized by its many rivers, as well as Milne Bay. Major rivers include the Fly, Kikori, Markham, and the Ramu. The Fly River is 1,127 kilometers (700 miles) long; roughly 70 percent of its length is navigable.</p>
               <p>The southwest coast is one of the largest swamp areas in the world, draining into the Gulf of Papua. Rising 61 meters (200 feet) above the swamp is the area of grassland known as the Oriomo Plateau.</p>
               <p>Because of its location along the Pacific “<related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88802611">Ring of Fire</related-article>,” Papua New Guinea experiences frequent <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88806722">earthquakes</related-article> and mudslides, and its islands have active volcanoes. Some of the smallest islands are <related-article related-article-type="no" xlink:href="88833179">coral</related-article> atolls.</p>

               <title>Cultural Sites &amp; Landmarks</title>
               <p>In 2008, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized the Kuk Early Agricultural Site as a cultural <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="87325532">World Heritage Site</related-article>. It is a protected area of 116 hectares (286 acres) of swamp in western New Guinea. Archaeological excavation has shown that the ancient site has been inhabited by humans for nearly ten thousand years. The Kuk Early Agricultural Site represents and illustrates the transition that humans in the area made from plant gathering to agrarian efforts, such as farming bananas, taro, and yam. It contains evidence of cultivation mounds, drainage ditches, and wooden farming tools, and also shows changes in agricultural practices over time. </p>
               <p>Papua New Guinea is also renowned for its undeveloped, diverse terrain, and for abundant tribal cultures. UNESCO is considering many of these culturally and environmentally important sites for inclusion on the World Heritage List. These include the Kikori River Basin and the Great Papuan Plateau, which covers 6 percent of the nation’s landmass, and the rugged Kokoda Track (also known as the Kokoda Trail) and Owen Stanley Ranges. Both of these are proposed as mixed sites distinguished for their <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88833150">biodiversity</related-article> and geographical importance, as well as for their cultural landscapes. The latter was the site of a famous <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="89116550">World War II</related-article> battle between the Australians and the Japanese in 1942. Other proposed sites include the Milne Bay Seascape, which incorporates uninhabited coral atolls and islands; the Sublime Karsts of Papua New Guinea, which feature distinct landscapes and sparse human activity; and the Upper Sepik River Basin, recognized for its diverse habitats and tribal cultures. </p>
               <p>Port Moresby is home to the National Museum and Art Gallery, which features one of the world’s most renowned collections of indigenous art, as well as extensive anthropological, archeological, and natural science exhibits. The National Museum encompasses the Department of Modern History Museum, which is dedicated to twentieth-century events in Papua New Guinea. The museum also features significant collections of World War II and other military artifacts. It also contains an extensive <related-article related-article-type="no" xlink:href="89250551">photography</related-article> collection documenting the islands’ wartime experience. The Port Moresby (Bomana) War Cemetery also reflects the toll of the war on the island, as it contains the remains of nearly four thousand British <related-article related-article-type="rs" xlink:href="88390977">Commonwealth</related-article> fighters who were casualties of the Allied effort to defend the territory from Japanese invasion.</p>
               <p>In addition, the Port Moresby’s National Botanical Gardens houses one of the world’s largest orchid collections. Originally affiliated with the adjoining University of Papua New Guinea, the gardens contain a wide <related-article related-article-type="no" xlink:href="89185687">sampling</related-article> of tropical vegetation indigenous to the region. Other attractions in the capital include the National Parliament building, which combines elements of traditional design within a modern architectural framework. It was built in 1984 in the style of a traditional haus tambaran or “spirit house” (an ancestral place of worship). In small villages, the spirit house is an elaborately decorated ceremonial structure around which tribal life revolves. </p>
