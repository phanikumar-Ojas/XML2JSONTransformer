While it is not certain if this John Webster was in fact the future playwright, most researchers believe that he was; the many references to the law in Webster’s plays support the possibility of his legal studies. It is supposed that Webster began his studies at New Inn before moving on to more advanced training at the Middle Temple. Webster probably did not complete a law degree; he may have attended the inns in order to help with his father’s business. In addition to his studies, Webster would have viewed the dramatic works of his contemporaries, as students often wrote and performed plays at the Inns of Court. His classmates would have included fellow playwrights <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

          <p>Webster left the inns to begin writing for professional theater, both in collaboration with other playwrights and on his own. He married Sara Peniall, then seven months pregnant, in 1606; the couple had at least five children.</p>

This period is known for city comedies and gruesome tragedies, the latter often associated with a prevailing pessimism that marked much public sentiment during James’s rule. Webster’s tragedies in particular feature almost unbearable cruelty. Critics often cite political overtones in Webster’s plays, which may be meant to critique problems of the Jacobean court. Webster’s plays were staged at a variety of theaters, particularly more intimate, enclosed ones. His style was strongly influenced by the Roman playwright <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Both Vittoria’s and Duke Brachiano’s spouses die; Vittoria is placed on trial for the murder, and sentenced; she escapes and marries Brachiano. Her brother and Duke Francisco de Medici, the brother of Brachiano’s dead wife, kill Brachiano under the direction of Count Lodovico, an enemy of Brachiano. Lodovico and his friend Gasparo then kill Flamineo, Vittoria, and her servant Zanche. At the play’s conclusion, the English ambassador passes sentence on Lodovico, and Giavonni, Brachiano’s son by his first wife, Isabella, is left to rule.</p>
          <p>Webster next wrote <italic>The Duchess of Malfi</italic>
                   (pr. 1614, pb. 1623), featuring a young widow who remarries despite her two brothers’ prohibitions. This play is also based upon actual events in sixteenth century Italian history. Duke Ferdinand and the cardinal, the brothers, are corrupt representatives of state and church, respectively, in clear contrast to the virtuous duchess and her household treasurer and secret new husband, Antonio. Ferdinand hires the opportunistic ex-soldier Bosola to spy on and then murder his sister; after her death, Bosola retaliates by taking revenge upon the brothers, but he accidentally kills Antonio and is in turn killed by Ferdinand. Order is restored when Antonio and the duchess’s eldest son is brought to power. The play, performed by the King’s Men at Blackfriars and the Globe, was published in 1623 with <italic>The Devil’s Law-Case</italic>
                   (pr. c. 1619-1622, pb. 1623).</p>
          <p>
            <italic>The Devil’s Law-Case</italic> was Webster’s solo tragicomedy. It centers on an unusual trial in which a widow tries to declare her son illegitimate, in order to remove him as an impediment to her remarriage and to deed his estate to her daughter. The work has two important elements that reverberate throughout Webster’s dramas: an unconventional, independent female lead and a courtroom setting, replete with legal banter.

          <p>Webster also wrote several nondramatic works, including his elegy “The Monumental Column” (1612), on the death of James I’s son Henry, prince of <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Two of Webster’s contributions to this collection were “The Virtuous Widow” and “The Common Widow,” the former remaining true to her husband’s memory by not remarrying, the latter a loose woman marrying as soon as she could after her first husband’s death. These portrayals paralleled the brothers’ views toward their sister in <italic>The Duchess of Malfi</italic>. In 1624, Webster was hired by the Merchant Taylors’ Company to write a pageant celebrating the election of the lord mayor’s of London.</p>

          <title>Significance</title>
          <p>Webster is most remembered for his remarkable tragedies, <italic>The White Devil</italic> and <italic>The Duchess of Malfi</italic>, and less so for the entire body of his work. He developed his female characters into multidimensional people, who arguably supercede William Shakespeare’s tragic heroines in their complexity and depth. His dark worldview and special attention to brilliant dialogue has continued to intrigue and provoke audiences and readers, resonating with such early modernist playwrights as <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
