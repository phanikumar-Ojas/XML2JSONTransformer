                  <title>Section 1—Summary</title>
                  <p>The novella opens in a lush valley near a river in California. Between the willow trees and sycamores is a beaten path that workers often trudge down to get from the highway to a riverbed, where they swim and camp out after long days of work. On this particular day, the path is being used by two men: a small, quick man with dark features named George and his big, lumbering companion named Lennie.</p>
                  <p>Lennie bends down to drink from a stagnant green pool of water, and George scolds him that he is going to get sick again. Through their interaction, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability. George asks what is in his pocket, and Lennie reluctantly reveals that it is a dead mouse that he wants to keep so he can pet it. Frustrated, George throws it across the river.</p>
                  <p>When Lennie asks where they are going, George reminds him that they are on their way to a new ranch like the one they had to escape in Weed, a town in northern California. Although they were supposed to arrive at their new job that night, the bus driver dropped them off too far away, and George wants to sleep under the stars anyway.</p>
                  <p>After George asks him to go and get kindling, Lennie returns soaking wet and carrying a single willow stick. George demands that Lennie give him the mouse he knows is in his pocket again. Lennie concedes before starting to cry and recalls how his Aunt Clara would give him mice, but he would always squeeze them too hard.</p>
                  <p>After the men finally have enough kindling to cook their beans, Lennie complains that he prefers his with ketchup. George yells about how he wishes he could have some semblance of a normal life but instead is stuck taking care of Lennie, who is always getting into trouble and causing them to lose their jobs. Lennie replies that he could go live in a cave somewhere so that George would not have to watch him anymore. This makes George feel guilty. He calms down and concedes that he is being too mean to Lennie.</p>
                  <p>Before they eat their beans, Lennie begs George to tell him again about the rabbits. George launches into a story he has told him many times about how they are different than other farm workers because not only do they have each other, but they have something to look forward to: as soon as they have enough money, they are going to buy a few acres of land with a house, garden, cows, chicken, and rabbit hutches for Lennie to tend to.</p>
                  <p>As they eat their dinner, George instructs Lennie to remember where they are in that very moment and to run back and hide here if he gets into trouble at his new job like he did in Weed. Lennie repeats George’s instructions and promises he will remember. The two men then roll out their bindles and sleep under the stars.</p>

                  <title>Section 1—Analysis</title>
                  <p>
                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols:</bold> The Great Depression; migrant workers; California; loneliness; friendship; humans versus nature</p>
                  <p>To understand the characters of George and Lennie, it is necessary to first examine both <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>’s authorial and historical context. John Steinbeck was born and raised in Salinas, California, and subsequently had an intimate knowledge of the state’s agricultural industry. In addition to growing up near some of the state’s most fertile farmland, Steinbeck earned money during high school and after dropping out of Stanford University by working in Salinas’s fields and packing plants. There, he observed the personalities, stories, and dialect of the type of workers who would later inform the characters of George and Lennie and their peers.</p>
                  <p>It is important to note that <italic>Of Mice and Men </italic>is a part of Steinbeck’s trilogy on agricultural labor in California during the Great Depression. During the 1930s, severe drought and dust storms caused more than two hundred thousand people to migrate from the Dust Bowl states in the Great Plains to California looking for work. There was not enough, however, and so many were forced to wander up and down the state with the changing seasons, waiting until certain crops were ripe and in need of people to harvest them.</p>
                  <p>Through the characters of George and Lennie, Steinbeck provides insight into the harsh realities that these thousands of poor, White, and homeless migrant workers faced during the 1930s. In the book’s first section, he focuses on one of the biggest challenges these men grappled with: loneliness. This motif is first introduced in the scene around the fire when George tells Lennie:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. They come to a ranch an’ work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they’re poundin’ their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got nothing to look ahead to.</p>
                  <p>Here, it becomes clear that what makes the two men different from other ranch workers is that they have each other. Initially, their relationship does not appear to be a friendship, as George is quick to berate Lennie and yell about how he would be better off without him. Despite these harsh words, however, George’s actions prove that he genuinely cares about Lennie. He attempts to protect him from getting sick drinking stagnant water, tells him what to do if he gets in trouble, and tries to break him of his bad habit of inadvertently killing innocent animals. He even is willing to tell him the bedtime story of how they will one day have a better life where Lennie can fulfill his dream of raising rabbits. Despite the rough exterior of their relationship, there is a genuine tenderness lurking underneath. Throughout the rest of the novel, their friendship becomes a distinct contrast to the chronic loneliness of nearly every other character they encounter.</p>
                  <p>One of the most interesting themes that Steinbeck explores in the first section is that there is an inherent conflict between humans and nature. The novella’s opening scene is a paradisal description of the lush valley, river, trees, and animals all living in harmony. Steinbeck writes about water “twinkling over yellow sands” and “willows fresh and green with every spring.” Meanwhile, the path that the workers use to escape the highway and go for a swim is depicted as being “beaten hard,” covered in campfire ashes, and is ultimately ugly in comparison to its surroundings—almost as if the presence of humanity is a blemish on the otherwise perfect Eden. Indeed, Steinbeck presents nature as having a religious quality; George’s desire to sleep under stars that night is an opportunity for him to commune with the godly beauty of nature before returning to the ugly struggle of civilization. The idea that humanity is ugly and flawed is one that is continuously explored throughout the rest of the novella.</p>

                  <title>Section 2—Summary</title>
                  <p>George and Lennie finally arrive to the new ranch where they will be working. There, they are met by Candy—an aging, one-handed “swamper” (a handyman) whose primary purpose is tending to his ancient, half-blind sheepdog. While they get settled in the bunkhouse, Candy tells them that the boss was angry that they did not show up the previous night as they had planned. He then remarks that otherwise the boss is a good enough man and even gave the workers a gallon of whiskey for Christmas.</p>
                  <p>The boss comes in and George does all the talking for both him and Lennie. This strikes the man as odd, and he immediately asks what the nature of their relationship is. George lies and says that Lennie is his cousin whom he has had to take care of because he was kicked in the head as a child. He then reassures the boss that while Lennie might not be bright, he is an extremely strong and hard worker. Still slightly suspicious at their peculiar relationship, the boss leaves.</p>
                  <p>Soon afterward, the boss’s son, Curley, arrives to the bunkhouse. A small, hotheaded man wearing heeled boots, Curley demands to know where his father is. Again, George does all the talking, which causes Curley to start picking on Lennie and demand that he speak when spoken to. George eventually gets Curley to stand down and leave in a huff.</p>
                  <p>Candy tells George and Lennie that Curley used to be a lightweight boxer and loves to start fights with men who are bigger than him. Since he got married two weeks earlier, Curley has become even meaner. Candy reckons this is because even though Curley has started wearing a glove on his left hand with Vaseline in it to keep it soft for his wife, she is a “tart” who likes to flirt with all of the ranch hands.</p>
                  <p>George warns Lennie to stay away from Curley and then reminds him that if he gets into any trouble to run back to the riverbed where they slept the night before and hide in the brush. Just then, a young woman wearing lots of makeup enters the bunkhouse looking for her husband. Lennie is clearly enchanted by Curley’s wife’s beauty, so after she leaves George warns him to stay away from her too. Feeling overwhelmed by all of these potentially dangerous people, Lennie asks if they can leave the ranch. George tells him no because they need the money.</p>
                  <p>Some of the men start coming back in from the fields. Of all of them, Slim, a “jerkline skinner”—the head driver of the team of mules—proves to be the most welcoming. As they all sit around, another ranch hand named Carlson asks Slim about his dog Lulu’s puppies. Slim replies that he had to drown four of the nine puppies because there was no way she could take care of them all. Carlson then suggests that Slim give one of the puppies to Candy so he can finally get rid of his stinky old sheepdog.</p>
                  <p>Curley returns to the bunkhouse, asking if anyone has seen his wife. George coldly replies that she was just there looking for him. Curley stares at George for a moment, seeming to really see him for the first time, and then leaves.</p>

                  <title>Section 2—Analysis</title>
                  <p>
                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols:</bold> American capitalism; the exploitation of workers; labor unions; good versus evil</p>
                  <p>In the novella’s second section, Steinbeck provides readers with further insight into what the everyday lives of migrant agricultural workers were like in 1930s California and the power dynamics that often defined their workplaces. Candy tells George and Lennie that, compared to other places, this particular ranch is a decent one to work at because the boss once gave them a bottle of whiskey to split at Christmas. There is a certain irony here that Candy is the one extolling the ranch when working there is what caused him to lose a hand. Ultimately, this scene between him, George, and Lennie discussing what life is like there demonstrates how low the bar was for what constituted “good” living conditions for the people on the bottom rungs of America’s economic system during this era.</p>
                  <p>Politically, Steinbeck was a leftist who abhorred both communism and capitalism. This is apparent throughout the entirety of his “California Series” or “Labor Trilogy” novels, which chronologically included <italic>In Dubious Battle </italic>(1936), <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>, and <italic>Grapes of Wrath</italic> (1939). While the other two novels criticize more directly American capitalism, the socioeconomic inequality it causes, and the way in which wealthy industrialists exploit the working class for their own gain, these ideas are also quite present in <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>. The ranch hands work long, hard days and have little to show for these efforts—just enough money to go to a brothel and get drunk on the weekends. Most own nothing besides their bindles and are so chronically lonely that they find George and Lennie’s commitment to working together to be odd, or even suspicious.</p>
                  <p>In some ways, it can be argued that the advantage that George and Lennie have by maintaining loyalty to one another while navigating work highlights how workers who band together have a distinct advantage over their peers. As such, their relationship can be interpreted as advocacy for labor unions—a topic that Steinbeck explored in his previous novel <italic>In Dubious Battle</italic> through his depiction of a fictitious strike organized by California fruit pickers.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, by having George and Lennie’s relationship function as a noticeable contrast to the status quo of the “lone and lonely worker,” Steinbeck highlights one of the fundamental obstacles preventing the working class from ever being able to claim a piece of the success that their capitalist employers enjoy: their refusal to care for one another. For Steinbeck, most working-class people did not recognize that they were proletariats being oppressed by the capitalist system and likely never to achieve upward mobility. Instead, they remained devoted to the illusion of the American Dream—a theme that comes more clearly into focus later in the novella.</p>
                  <p>Steinbeck introduces many important characters in the second section of the novella, but there are two in particular who stand out: Curley and Slim. Because there is a stark contrast between them, these two characters can be considered foils. Curley is hateful, angry, and tries to use the fact that he is the boss’s son to maintain power over the other workers. Meanwhile, Slim is described as “the prince of the ranch.” The author further describes Slim in this passage:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">There was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love.</p>
                  <p>When comparing the two, it can be argued that Curley represents the worst of human nature while Slim represents the best. This idea is amplified by the fact that out of everyone, Curley and Slim have the most influence over their coworkers’ behavior.</p>
                  <p>As a writer, Steinbeck typically does not sugarcoat nor demonize his characters but instead presents them as multifaceted, flawed beings. George, for example, is the closest thing the novella has to a protagonist or “hero,” but he is also extremely cynical and can be mean to Lennie. Out of all the characters, the one who comes across as wholly “good” is Slim. The fact that Slim is romanticized to be a prototypical, ruggedly handsome cowboy who wears a Stetson hat is indicative of the respect and admiration that Steinbeck had for migrant workers.</p>

                  <title>Section 3—Summary</title>
                  <p>George and Slim retire to the bunkhouse after a full day’s work and sit down for a game of cards. George thanks Slim for giving Lennie one of Lulu’s pups, and Slim responds that Lennie is an impressively hard worker. He then comments on how strange it is that George and Lennie travel together as most migrant workers are loners.</p>
                  <p>George explains that he and Lennie grew up in the same town. After Lennie’s Aunt Clara died, there was no one to look after him and he began tagging along with George to work. Initially, George used to exploit Lennie’s intellectual disability for fun. But when Lennie almost drowned because George told him to jump in the river, George was so ashamed of his own behavior that he became committed to protecting his friend.</p>
                  <p>George confesses that Lennie has always needed a lot of protection because people mistake him for being scary when he is actually a gentle giant. He explains that during their most recent job in Weed, Lennie grabbed a local woman’s dress because he wanted to “pet” its red fabric. The girl got scared and pulled away, which made Lennie’s grip even tighter, and George had to hit him on the head until he let go. Later, the girl accused Lennie of rape, and they had to hide in an irrigation ditch from a lynch mob before escaping town.</p>
                  <p>Carlson enters the bunkhouse and tries to convince Candy to euthanize his beloved dog, but Candy does not want to because he raised it from a pup. When Slim weighs in on the issue and agrees it is the moral thing to do, Carlson offers to shoot the dog in the back of the head and bury it himself. Candy finally concedes.</p>
                  <p>Crooks, a Black ranch worker described as the “stable buck,” arrives to announce that he has warm tar ready for one of the mule’s hooves. After Slim leaves with him, the rest of the men start talking about how Curley’s flirtatious wife will inevitably get one of them in trouble. As if on cue, Curley shows up looking for her and learns that Slim is in the barn. Worried that she and Slim are having an affair, he storms off to find them.</p>
                  <p>Now mostly alone, George gives into Lennie’s request and begins telling him about the farm they are going to buy where he can tend rabbits. After eavesdropping for a while, Candy interrupts them and asks if this place really exists and how much it costs. When George says it does, Candy excitedly admits that he has nearly that much in his own savings and will give it all to them if they make him a partner and let him do odd jobs there. Shocked that their dream might actually come true, George agrees and says he will write the property’s owners. Before the other men return, Candy confesses that he should have shot his own dog himself.</p>
                  <p>Just then, Slim, Curley, Carlson, and Whit enter the bunkhouse. Curley clearly wants to fight Slim but begins punching Lennie instead. Lennie stands still, helplessly terrified. When George tells him to fight back, Lennie takes Curley’s right hand in his own and crushes it. The fight gets broken up, and Slim makes Curley promise to say that his hand was destroyed by machinery rather than Lennie so that he and George will not get fired. Curley reluctantly agrees and is taken to the nearest hospital.</p>

                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols:</bold> Candy’s dog; obsolescence; self-worth; the power of dreams; hope; hands</p>
                  <p>The third section’s plot points are all significant and move the story forward; however, the most memorable of these is the scene where the men convince Candy to let Carlson kill his dog. A large part of what makes the scene so disturbing is the fact that it happens so quickly that Candy does not get to say goodbye to the only real friend he has in the world. Furthermore, Carlson’s insistence that it is time for the dog to die comes from a selfish place—really, he cares more about getting rid of the dog’s smell in the bunkhouse than its suffering. However, even Slim agrees that euthanasia is the morally correct thing to do, and this speaks to one of the novella’s larger themes that doing the “hard thing” and the “right thing” are often the same. Candy himself acknowledges this idea when he confesses to George that he regrets letting his beloved dog be killed by Carlson, who did not care about it, instead of doing it himself.</p>
                  <p>The death of Candy’s dog highlights some of agricultural workers’ greatest fears: the obsolescence that comes with old age. Like most 1930s-era working class indviduals, Candy’s self-worth and identity is linked to his physical abilities. There was no place or purpose in America for people like him outside of low-paid manual labor. Therefore, the fact that he has a physical disability and is getting older means that he is no longer a valuable commodity in the marketplace of American capitalism. The only reason that he has a job as the ranch “swamper” is because he lost his hand in an accident there and, along with a small financial settlement, it is part of his employer’s restitution to him. It is for this reason that Candy is so excited about the idea of getting in on George and Lennie’s future farm and is willing to pay for most of it just for the opportunity to do odd jobs on the property. For him, the idea of the farm is appealing because it is a place where he would have a sense of autonomy and value. This fact becomes clear when Candy tells George:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says he wasn’t no good to himself nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht somebody’d shoot me. But they won’t do nothing like that. I won’t have no place to go, an’ I can’t get no more jobs. I’ll have thirty dollars more comin’, time you guys is ready to quit.</p>
                  <p>Candy’s enthusiasm for getting in on George and Lennie’s farm illustrates one of the novella’s most important themes of dreams and the complex role they play in people’s lives. More often than not, dreams represent people’s hope for a better future. Ultimately, they can be addicting because focusing on the future allows people to forget the harsh reality of their present. It is for this reason that Lennie, who only wants to talk about his and George’s dream, often functions as a symbol for hope throughout <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>. Like the emotion of hopefulness, Lennie has a childlike optimism and enthusiasm to him. He also has the ability to inspire people or destroy them.</p>
                  <p>It is through the character of Curley that Steinbeck demonstrates how dreams can become double-edged swords when people cling too tightly to them. Although he is past his prime, Curley still fantasizes about becoming a professional boxer. It is thanks to this dream, and the fact that it remains frustratingly out of reach, that he is always picking fights with bigger men, which in turn leads to his downfall. When Lennie crushes Curley’s hand, he also destroys Curley’s chances of ever boxing again.</p>
                  <p>Hands are a reoccurring motif found throughout <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>. In addition to the men being referred to as “ranch hands” or simply “hands,” Steinbeck focuses on the ways that all of the characters’ hands differ from one another. In this way, hands can be interpreted as a representation of their identities. For example, Candy’s missing right hand is indicative of how useless he feels as an aging worker. Curley keeps his left hand in a glove with Vaseline to keep it soft for his wife, an action that can be interpreted as a metaphor for his struggles to keep her romantic attention. Meanwhile, Lennie’s hands are demonstrative of the inherent conflict of his character—that he does not realize his own strength. Although he wants to use them for nice things like stroking mice and puppies, he always ends up hurting the things he touches.</p>

                  <title>Section 4—Summary</title>
                  <p>Crooks is sitting alone on his bunk in the harness room when Lennie suddenly appears looking for company. Crooks tells him to leave—if he, a Black man, cannot be inside the bunkhouse with the White workers, then Lennie should not be allowed in his room. Lennie explains that he is lonely because all the other men have gone into town. At the sight of his naïve smile, Crooks concedes.</p>
                  <p>Lennie tells Crooks about his plan to buy a farm with George and Candy. Crooks scoffs and says that every ranch hand has that same unrealistic dream. He then begins talking about his childhood. He tells Lennie that his parents owned a chicken farm in an area of California where they were the only Black family. His father would warn him against White people, which he did not understand as a child but as an adult he has become all too familiar with racism.</p>
                  <p>Crooks asks Lennie what he would do if George just never came back. Lennie responds that George would never do that to him, but Crooks continues to pose the hypothetical question until Lennie gets upset. When it seems like Lennie might become violent, Crooks backs down and reassures him that George will come back for him.</p>
                  <p>Candy shows up looking for Lennie and tells him he has been looking over the numbers and has found a way for them to make money from the rabbits on their future farm. Because Candy is also talking about the farm dream, Crooks realizes that it is not just part of Lennie’s imagination but a real plan. He asks them if he might be able to join them too.</p>
                  <p>Just then, Curley’s wife appears and asks about her husband’s whereabouts before stating that she knows he went to a brothel with the rest of the men. They try to get her to leave, but she ignores them and begins talking about how unhappy and lonely she is in her marriage. After noticing that his face is bruised, she deduces that it was Lennie who hurt Curley’s hand and not the machine like he claimed.</p>
                  <p>Crooks says that if she does not leave his room, he will report her inappropriate behavior. She responds with a threat, saying that she will do something even more terrible to him if he tries that. When they can hear the other men returning from town, she tells Lennie that she is glad that he hurt Curley and then leaves. As Candy and Lennie also get up to leave, Crooks calls after them and tells them he does not want to be part of the future farm after all. Alone again, he lays on his bed thinking for a moment and then rubs liniment on his crooked, aching back.</p>

                  <title>Section 4—Analysis</title>
                  <p>
                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols: </bold>Societal inequality; racism; power; dreams</p>
                  <p>One of the novella’s central themes is that the thousands of agricultural workers in California who made feeding early twentieth-century America possible were ultimately being crushed by the same industry that they were keeping afloat. In the early sections, Steinbeck illustrates this by focusing on the experience of the White, male migrant worker—the kind with whom he hoped his readers might empathize and relate. In its fourth section, however, the novella turns its attention to its marginalized characters to demonstrate that there were other members of society who suffered significantly more in the world of California agriculture than White, male migrant workers. Because Candy has a physical disability, he gets dismissed by the industry, his employer, and his coworkers as being an unimportant, disposable being. Meanwhile, as a woman, Curley’s wife has no real autonomy or rights. In fact, Steinbeck does not even give her character a name. The only way that she can demonstrate power and free will is by flirting with the other men.</p>
                  <p>The chief protagonist in the fourth section is another marginalized character, Crooks. Steinbeck’s depiction of Crooks up until this point reflects the way in which he is perceived and treated by his White peers. Because he is not allowed to play horseshoe with the other men or spend time in the bunkhouse, Crooks initially comes across as an unimportant tertiary character who exists around the periphery of the story. By making him the central focus in this section, however, Steinbeck forces readers to recognize his humanity, how important his experience is, and how unjust his treatment is. Despite being an educated Black man from a good family, Crooks is segregated from everyone else on the ranch and forced to sleep in the harness room as if he were an animal. At one point, it is revealed that Candy has never even visited Crooks’s room despite the fact that they have both lived on the ranch for years.</p>
                  <p>Through the interaction of Crooks, Lennie, Candy, and Curley’s wife, Steinbeck succeeds in demonstrating the way that societal inequality leads to competition and conflict among the most disenfranchised, making it impossible for them to unite against their oppressors. Crooks resents Lennie for being blissfully ignorant and hopeful about the future, so he lashes out by using the only power he has over him, his intellect, and tries to convince him that George might not come back for him. Meanwhile, Curley’s wife, with few rights or freedoms, is able to wield power over Crooks because she is a White woman. This fact becomes devastatingly clear when he tells her to leave his room or he will report her to Curley, and she responds by alluding to the fact that she could have him lynched if she wanted.</p>
                  <p>Through Crooks’s conversation with Lennie and Candy, Steinbeck demonstrates again just how intoxicating dreams can be. When Lennie first tells him about how he and his friends are going to buy a farm, Crooks dismisses it as the ramblings of a man with an intellectual disability. Then Candy confirms that not only is the plan to buy the farm viable, but it is underway and likely to happen. Suddenly, Crooks gets caught up in their excitement and shyly asks if they would have use for someone like him there. It is only after Curley’s wife threatens him with racial violence that he is brought back down to Earth and remembers that good things rarely happen to disenfranchised people like himself in America, and it is best to avoid dreams altogether.</p>

                  <title>Section 5—Summary</title>
                  <p>Lennie sits in the barn by himself stroking his puppy’s body. He talks to himself, wondering why the puppy died when he bounced it. Realizing that its death might mean that he will no longer be allowed to tend rabbits, Lennie throws the puppy across the room in frustration. He then retrieves its body and begins stroking it again.</p>
                  <p>Curley’s wife enters and Lennie tries to hide the puppy in the hay. He tells her that George says he cannot speak to her, but she reassures him that it is fine—all of the men are outside playing horseshoes anyway. Curley’s wife then reveals that she has always dreamed of being a star and once had the opportunity to join a traveling show when she was a teenager, but her mother would not let her. When she was older, a talent scout said he would bring her to Hollywood, but she never received the letter he promised. She became so frustrated that she ended up marrying Curley, whom she hates.</p>
                  <p>When Curley’s wife asks him why he likes animals and rabbits so much, Lennie responds that he enjoys touching soft things. She says that he can stroke her hair as long as he does not muss it up. However, he quickly gets too excited. She yells out in fear, and he clamps his hand around her mouth to silence her, causing her to struggle even more. He tries to calm her down by making his grip tighter and shaking her until she goes limp.</p>
                  <p>Realizing that he has broken her neck, Lennie tries to bury her body in the hay. He then scoops up the dead puppy and starts running to the spot that George told him to go if he was in trouble. After Candy finds Curley’s wife soon afterward, he brings George in, who immediately deduces what has happened. He posits that maybe they can get Lennie peacefully into a correctional facility or mental institution where he will be taken care of, but Candy tells him that Curley is going to have him lynched. He asks if they can still buy the farm, and George says no—he never really thought it was possible anyway, but Lennie always made him believe it was.</p>
                  <p>To ensure that it does not seem like he had anything to do with the death of Curley’s wife, George tells Candy to wait before telling everyone and then he will return and pretend to be shocked. Candy obliges. When George reenters with the rest of the men a few minutes later, he hangs at the back wearing a buttoned-up jacket and looks weary. Curley demands that they kill Lennie, and Carlson remarks that his gun is missing and guesses that Lennie stole it before fleeing. The posse decides to get Crooks’s shotgun before heading out.</p>

                  <title>Section 5—Analysis</title>
                  <p>
                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols:</bold> Gender; masculinity; sexism</p>
                  <p>Gender is a reoccurring motif in <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>. Throughout the novella, Steinbeck focuses primarily on the experience of working-class men—their struggles; their feelings of loneliness; and the nature of their friendships. This is evident in the characters’ behavior, which consists of stereotypical examples of masculinity like manual labor, fist fights, jeering at each other while they play horseshoes, or traveling into town so that they can drink whiskey and sleep with prostitutes. Steinbeck does not condemn this behavior, but he does provide evidence that men are capable of more. Specifically, he uses the characters of George, Candy, and Lennie to demonstrate that men are capable of being kind and nurturing. George, after all, is constantly looking out for Lennie, and Candy kept his ancient dog alive by essentially spoon-feeding it. Furthermore, the behemoth Lennie just wants to pet and tend to rabbits. Even the character of Slim, who is ostensibly a macho cowboy, succeeds in defying traditional male behavior. In the novella’s third section, for example, he conducts an honest, vulnerable conversation with George and really listens to what he has to say. Because Slim is the “prince of the ranch” and presented as the ideal man, it can be concluded that Steinbeck believes his ability to balance strength with morality, empathy, and sensitivity is something that all men should try to adopt.</p>
                  <p>Some critics contend that <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic> puts forward an extremely sexist point of view against women. The only female characters discussed in its pages are Lennie’s Aunt Clara and Susy, the proprietor of a nearby brothel. Meanwhile, there is just one woman whom the male characters actually interact with: Curley’s wife. From the moment she is introduced, readers are not provided with a very good impression of her. The male ranch hands regularly describe her as a “tart,” “tramp,” and “looloo” because of the way she dresses and, ostensibly, is trying to flirt with them. For them, she is nothing but a temptress on whom they can blame their worst behavior, as evidenced by George’s summation of her:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">She’s gonna make a mess. They’s gonna be a bad mess about her. She’s a jail bait all set on the trigger.</p>
                  <p>Readers may feel inclined to believe these nasty accusations against Curley’s wife because Steinbeck presents her in the way that the men see her. He notes her makeup, red fingernails, and the way her curled hair looks like “little sausages.” Furthermore, he does not give her a name but instead refers to her as “Curley’s wife”—someone with no independence whom the men perceive as another man’s property rather than someone deserving of selfhood. However, when she opens up to the other marginalized characters in Crooks’s room in the novella’s fourth section, it becomes clear that Curley’s wife is just another chronically lonely person who wants someone to talk to. This idea is continued in the fifth section through her interaction with Lennie when she tells him about how her dashed dreams as a starlet led her to make the poor decision of marrying a man whom she hates.</p>
                  <p>It is important to note that while the male characters try to paint Curley’s wife as a “tart,” that is not her true self but rather how the world treats her. In a letter to actor Claire Luce, who was playing the part of Curley’s wife in a 1938 stage adaptation of the novella, Steinbeck offered the following description of Curley’s wife:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">She learned to be hard to cover her fright. And automatically she became hardest when she was most frightened. She is a nice, kind girl, not a floozy. No man has ever considered her as anything except a girl to try to make. She has never talked to a man except in the sexual fencing conversation. She is not highly sexed particularly but knows instinctively that if she is to be noticed at all, it will be because some one finds her sexually desirable.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>’s presentation of Curley’s wife demonstrates just how challenging 1930s America was for working-class women. In addition to not having any real employment opportunities or economic autonomy, men dismissed women as being either maternal figures or prostitutes. By having Lennie be the one to inadvertently kill her, Steinbeck draws a parallel to the mice and puppies he has also killed. Like these animals, Curley’s wife was essentially an “innocent creature” who was crushed beneath the unjust, cruel circumstances of working-class agricultural life.</p>

                  <title>Section 6—Summary</title>
                  <p>Lennie arrives at the riverbed where he and George first camped out together. While initially proud of himself for remembering where to go, these feelings are quickly interrupted by a vision of his Aunt Clara scolding him for causing problems for George, his only friend in the world. Immediately afterward, Lennie has a vision of a giant rabbit who tells him that George will probably abandon him now.</p>
                  <p>To Lennie’s relief, George soon arrives. He gives Lennie his usual spiel about how he would be better off without him, but there is a sadness in his delivery this time. When Lennie offers to exile himself to a cave somewhere, George tells him that he wants him to stay. Upon Lennie’s request, he then launches into the speech he has given his friend countless times before about how most men like them have no family or anyone else in the world who gives a “hoot in hell about ’em,” but they are different because they have each other.</p>
                  <p>Lennie asks George to tell him again about how it will be at their future farm, and George tells him to look across the river so he can envision everything he says. Lennie obliges and as George describes their farm together, he shoots Lennie in the back of the head.</p>
                  <p>The other men from the ranch arrive soon after at the sound of the gunshot and find George on the ground looking shaken and upset. He tells them that he had to wrestle the gun away from Lennie and ended up shooting him in self-defense. Slim tells George that he did what he had to and tries to console him by offering to take him out for a drink. As they walk away together, Carlson turns to Curley and says, “Now what the hell ya suppose is eatin’ them two guys?”</p>

                  <title>Section 6—Analysis</title>
                  <p>
                     <bold>Major Themes, Motifs, and Symbols:</bold> Carlson’s gun; killing as an act of morality; <italic>To a Mouse</italic>; the American Dream; capitalism; friendship</p>
                  <p>
                     <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic>’s sixth and final section is also its shortest. It is in these paragraphs that all of the novella’s setups and foreshadowing finally come to a head. Just as Candy’s dog was euthanized with Carlson’s gun, so is Lennie. The only difference is that this time, George heeds Candy’s advice and does the difficult act of killing Lennie himself in a merciful way instead of letting him die scared and confused at the hands of strangers. Here, Steinbeck seems to suggest that sometimes killing someone can be a moral act—an idea that is confirmed by Slim, the ranch’s voice of justice and authority, who comforts George by sitting down beside him and confirming that “a guy got to sometimes.”</p>
                  <p>
                     <italic>Of Mice and Men</italic> has many messages for its readers, but arguably one of its most important is that dreams are a powerful force of motivation that often do not come to fruition because life is simply too harsh. This idea is alluded to in the title of the novel, which is taken from the seventh stanza of the 1785 poem <italic>To a Mouse </italic>by Scottish poet Robert Burns:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">But Mousie, thou art no thy-lane,</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">In proving foresight may be vain:</p>
                  <p content-type="extract">The best-laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men</p>
                  <disp-quote content-type="poetry1">
                  <p>Gang aft agley,</p></disp-quote>
                  <p content-type="extract">An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,</p>
                  <disp-quote content-type="poetry1">
                  <p>For promis’d joy!</p></disp-quote>
                  <p>Here, Burns is referring to how a mouse’s plans for its future living in a nest that it built has been destroyed by the narrator’s plow. Similarly, Lennie and George’s dream for their future living on a farm has been destroyed by the reality of their circumstances. Like so many working-class people trying to survive in the American capitalist system, they were motivated by the belief that if they worked hard enough, they too could achieve the American Dream and eventually buy their own place and become their own bosses. Throughout the novella, George and Lennie often refer to this idea as living “off the fat of the land.”</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, Steinbeck demonstrates, the American Dream is nothing more than an out-of-reach illusion for many workers during this time. The only people getting rich “off the fat of the land” are companies and wealthy industrialists—in the capitalist food chain, workers, women, people of color, and those with disabilities are at the bottom and subsequently considered insignificant. As such, they are the ones who are the most oppressed and vulnerable to having their lives destroyed by America.</p>
                  <p>The final scene, in which George kills Lennie, is devastating because of how much the two men care about one another. It is an act of selfless sacrifice on George’s behalf; by doing what is kindest and most merciful to Lennie, he is making things much harder emotionally and mentally for himself. Lennie died happy and unaware that he was in trouble and betrayed by his best friend whereas George will be haunted by the memory of his death for the rest of his life.</p>
                  <p>It is in the novella’s conclusion that it offers readers two of its most important ideas. The first of these is the importance of caring for others. More specifically, how creating bonds with other people and taking care of each other can bring tremendous meaning to life. Where characters like Candy, Crooks, and Curley’s wife were unhappy because they were so lonely, George was able to enjoy the simple things in life like sleeping under the stars because watching over Lennie and being his friend gave his life purpose. While this idea might seem too sentimental, it is immediately punctuated by a more caustic message: life in America is often a cold, harsh reality. This is evidenced by the final lines of the novella, in which Curley and Carlson seem completely unfazed by Lennie’s death and cannot fathom why Slim and George are so upset. Just like the capitalist system they exist within that strips all workers of their humanity, Curley and Carlson do not see Lennie as a person; instead, he is simply another disposable entity.</p>
