                  regarded war as desirable. They allowed autonomy to so-called “enemies of the
                  house” who participated in scheduled conflicts known as Flower Wars, in which
                  Aztec warriors, armed with obsidian-bladed clubs, bows, darts, and slings and
                  arrayed in the regalia of the military orders of the Eagle, Jaguar, Serpent, or a
                  similar symbol, took prisoners for sacrifice. Unlike the Aztecs, the Inca Empire
                  was highly centralized, and its soldiers fought in disciplined formations. War was
                  a means to an end, not an end in itself. Their <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                  illegal expedition to Mexico with six hundred men, twenty horses, and ten cannons.
                  At Cozumel, he rescued a castaway, Jerónimo de Aguilar, who knew the Mayan
                  language. On the Tabascan coast, Cortés skirmished with that tribe before
                  concluding an alliance and taking a woman, Malinche, as his mistress and
                  interpreter. On April 21, Cortés landed and founded a town, Villa Rica de Vera

                  defeated the Tlaxcalans, then allied with these Aztec enemies. In
                     <bold>Cholula</bold> (October 12), suspecting an ambush, he slaughtered that
                  city’s nobility. On November 8, he reached Tenochtitlán, built on an island in
                  Lake Texcoco. Montezuma greeted Cortés, who took the Aztec emperor hostage and
                  ruled through him. In late April, 1520, Cortés returned to the coast to persuade
                  an expedition sent to arrest him to join him instead. He returned to Tenochtitlán
                  on June 24 with 1,300 Spaniards and 2,000 Tlaxcalan troops to discover that his
                  men had slaughtered Aztec nobles at a religious ceremony. The Aztecs then chose
                  Cuauhtemóc as emperor, and Montezuma was killed, either by the Spaniards or his
                  own people. On <bold>La Noche Triste</bold> (June 30), Cortés and his men fought
                  their way to the mainland. Only 460 Spaniards survived, all wounded. Cortés spent
                  the next several months winning Indian allies, securing his supply lines, and
                  recruiting reinforcements. In December, he returned to Lake Texcoco with 800
                  Spanish infantry, 100 horsemen, 8 cannons, and a Tlaxcalan army that grew to
                  100,000. For the <bold>Siege of Tenochtitlán</bold> (May to August 23, 1521),
                  Cortés had 13 brigantines constructed, blockaded the Aztec city, and destroyed it.
                  Smallpox ravaged the Aztec defenders who, blockaded, could not replace their
                  losses; on August 23, 1521, Cuauhtemóc surrendered to Cortés.</p>

                  opposed by the administrators of the property who, led by Huáscar’s half-brother
                  Atahualpa, defeated Huáscar and took him prisoner. Pizarro advanced into the
                  highlands toward <bold>Cajamarca</bold> (1532), where Atahualpa was encamped with
                  his army. Inspired by Cortés’s tactics in Mexico, Pizarro sent a message asking to
                  meet the Inca leader, and laid an ambush for him. Unconcerned, Atahualpa entered
                  the deserted city square borne on his golden litter with his personal guard. The
                  trap was sprung, with cannon fire and horsemen scattering and killing the guards.
                  Pizarro seized Atahualpa and used him as a puppet for Spanish rule. Atahualpa
                  attempted to ransom himself by filling a room with gold, but when it was done,
                  Pizarro executed him. Pizarro then took <bold>Cuzco</bold> (November, 1533),
                  assisted by Huáscar’s faction, which took revenge on Atahualpa’s followers. From
                  that faction, Pizarro chose Manco Capac as his puppet emperor, but Manco escaped,
                  raised an army, and laid siege to Cuzco for ten months before withdrawing into the
                  Andes. After the siege, the Spanish fought a factional war for control of Cuzco,
                  leading to Pizarro’s assassination in 1541. Pizarro’s brother, Gonzalo Pizarro,
                  regained power, even murdering a viceroy, but stopped short of declaring himself
                  king. Peru remained unsettled until the arrival in 1569 of Viceroy Francisco de
                  Toledo, who finished the Inca conquest when a Spanish force took the Incas’
                  mountain strongholds and executed their emperor, Tupac Amaru, in 1572.</p>
