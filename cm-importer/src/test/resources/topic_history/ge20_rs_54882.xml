               <p>Meinecke’s modifications to the historicist program marked the beginning of a new approach to historiography: the analytic school of political history. Essentially, this school sought to analyze the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"

                                   xlink:type="simple">causes of social change</related-article> and their consequences for nations around the world. In his book, Meinecke attempted to construct an explanation of the timing and structure of the process of national unification as it occurred within the German <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="no"

                                   xlink:type="simple">Confederation</related-article> (1815-1866). In a manner that would become the defining characteristic of his analytic style, Meinecke framed the period in terms of two opposing intellectual currents and then built his narrative around the force generated by their contradictions. In this case, the two conflicting concepts were cosmopolitanism and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"

               <p>Meinecke’s cosmopolitanism is a set of beliefs centered on the notion of the fundamental unity of all humankind. This unity, however, has different implications depending on whether it is considered from a cultural, moral, political, or economic <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="no"

                                   xlink:type="simple">point of view</related-article>. Unity of cultural practices worldwide is not conceivable in a world where uniformity would necessarily entail the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

                                   xlink:type="simple">extinction</related-article> of some cultural practices in favor of others. This problem is real and present; many in the poorest nations already believe that the powerful Western nations are crowding out the cultural space formerly allotted to them. This is sometimes called cultural imperialism. These issues and others are part of the complex of events, trends, and peoples referred to under the heading of “<related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"

               <p>If everyone and every group are considered to be equal from the moral perspective, then everyone is equally able to lay claim to sympathy and substance, irrespective of ethnicity, creed, or place of residence. This is the Enlightenment spirit of kinship and tolerance for all of humanity. Thus the moral principle that underpins cosmopolitan beliefs also forms the basis for the concept of “<related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"
                                   xlink:href="89677570"
                                   xlink:type="simple">human rights</related-article>.” Further consideration of the political and economic spheres leads in the direction of global systems of governance and wealth creation that undertake to reduce present levels of global inequality and increase the access of the poorest nations to resources, goods, and services.</p>
               <p>Nationalism, on the other hand, connotes identity with and loyalty to one’s nation; this becomes the paramount virtue. Nations are believed to be <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Although members of a particular nation may not share the same geographic location, they frequently share an ideology that creates a sense of common identity even as members migrate. Modern nations frequently exclude potential members on the basis of religion or ethnicity, and it is possible for two groups of people to occupy a common geography and still retain radically different nationalist beliefs.</p>
               <p>Meinecke began his account by tracing the history of the two concepts, showing how contradictory elements from each were embedded in the works of such German intellectuals as <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The fact that these contradictions lay at the very foundations of German political thought helps to explain the tardiness of the development of a unified German nation. It was also a major factor in early difficulties encountered in dealing with the implications of the distribution of power among the members of the European political economy. The presence of a cosmopolitan current of thought in the German cultural makeup, Meinecke argued, was a fundamental reason for the failure of the 1848 revolution and thus arrested the development of a unified <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Bismarck’s nationalist leadership liberated the culture from the cosmopolitan spirit that had inhibited the natural emergence of a strong German state.</p>
               <p>Meinecke acknowledged that coercive power was sometimes necessary for states to achieve their goals. He was convinced that Germany was a highly developed state that could utilize its power to best serve its cultural values and to promote individualism. The use of violence was not criminal, he said, if it was the only way the unification process could be accomplished, and this idea effectively displaced the rational ideals of the Enlightenment in favor of Romantic nationalism. Meinecke altered his views on state violence in the wake of the horrors of <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

He went from adherence to monarchism to a belief in the necessity (if not the sufficiency) of a popular republican system, and in the process he became disenchanted with the potential for improving human <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>The enduring impacts of Meinecke’s contributions are evident in the important relationship between the history of ideas and diplomatic history. Meinecke laid the foundations for the development of the modern field of <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                                   related-article-type="rs"

While he did not succeed in solving or dissolving these many antinomies, he did more than any thinker of his time to expose the contradictory forces at work in the international arena and to devise intellectual tools that were adequate to the analytic tasks at hand.</p>
               <p>Meinecke’s version of the historicist methodology came to define the frontier of sophisticated discourse on the nature of historical knowledge and on the determination of the appropriate units of analysis for historical inquiry. His combination of the subjects and techniques of intellectual and social history opened a novel and highly productive field of investigation, and the questions and problems Meinecke raised continued to be highly relevant to later scholars.
