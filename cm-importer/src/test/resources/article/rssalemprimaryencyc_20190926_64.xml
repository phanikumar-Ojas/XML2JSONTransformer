					             <p>Lennon started as a member of the Quarrymen in Liverpool, England. He met and recruited McCartney at a church festival. Harrison got in by auditioning in 1958.</p>
					             <p>They started with the name the Silver Beetles. The name changed to the Beatles in August 1960. It was also the year the group left Liverpool for Hamburg, Germany. By this time, the members were Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best.</p>
					             <p>The Beatles performed at a club, Indra. Their popularity grew through word of mouth. The Beatles were moved to the larger Kaiserkeller club when Indra closed.</p>
					             <p>In November 1960, the Beatles wanted to play at another club, Top Ten. This breached their contract. The manager of the Kaiserkeller got back at the group. Soon after, the Beatles were back in Liverpool.</p>
					             <p>In 1961 Sutcliffe left the group. He returned to Hamburg, where he died the next year. Also in 1961, the Beatles met Brian Epstein. He became their manager. Under Epstein, they changed their image. They wore their now iconic suits and boots.</p>
