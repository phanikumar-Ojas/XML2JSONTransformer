School book clubs continued to supply children with books and other materials throughout the 1990s but also began supplying classrooms with literacy materials in the form of trade books for elementary literacy programs. These book clubs also began supplying miscellaneous merchandise to children. Some of the most popular serialized school book club titles in the 1990s, such as those of the Baby-sitters Club, Sweet Valley High, and Boxcar Children mystery series, included miscellaneous merchandise such as stickers, posters, puzzles, stamps, pencils, activity sheets, "

Some people feel hesitant about joining these online groups, fearing that they will lack the intimacy and spontaneity of in-person meetings. Readers cannot always make it to book club meetings, however, which makes the online option a more convenient one. Furthermore, online book clubs allow people to join a conversation when it is most convenient for them. And although these online communities plan their virtual meetings ahead of time, anyone can add a comment when they want and read at their own pace. Doing some research, one can find out what type of online book clubs exist out there and join. "
