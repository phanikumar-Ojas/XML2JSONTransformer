          <title>Diagnostic and Treatment Techniques</title>
          <p>Prior to the birth, several diagnostic procedures are commonly employed by the perinatologist: ultrasonography, the measurement of fetal activity, and the evaluation of fetal lung maturity. Ultrasonography uses sound waves to create images. Sound waves are transmitted from a transducer that has been placed on the skin. Waves that are sent into the body reflect off internal tissues and structures, and the reflections are received by a microphone. Sound travels through tissues with different densities at different rates, which are characteristic for each tissue. <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                             related-article-type="no"

The images must be interpreted or read by someone with specialized training, usually a <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

          <p>The measurement of fetal activity is important in evaluating fetal health. Fetal movement is normal; the earliest movement felt by the mother is called quickening. The diminution or cessation of fetal movement is indicative of fetal distress
                  . Accordingly, movement is monitored by reports from the mother, <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2570">palpation</xref> by the clinician, and ultrasound: Mothers report movements, individuals examining pregnant women can apply their hands to the <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1002">abdomen</xref> and feel fetal movements, and <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.3227">ultrasonography</xref> can show breathing and other movements in real time using continuous video records of fetal movements.</p>
          <p>Fetal lung maturity is assessed by measuring the relative amounts of lecithin and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
                             related-article-type="rs"

                             xlink:type="simple">sphingomyelin</related-article> in amniotic fluid. The concentration of lecithin increases late in fetal development, while sphingomyelin decreases. A lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio that is greater than two indicates sufficient fetal lung maturity to ensure survival after birth.</p>
          <p>Labor and delivery are the primary events of the perinatal period. Factors that can lead to difficulties include abnormalities of the 
                  <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2684">placenta</xref> and prematurity. The placenta can be abnormally located (placenta previa) or can separate prematurely (placenta abruptio). Normally, the placenta is located on the lateral wall of the uterus. Placenta previa is defined as a placenta located in the lower portion of the uterus. The placenta is compressed by the 
                  <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1786">fetus</xref> during passage through the birth canal. This compression compromises the blood <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

This condition is usually managed by a cesarean section. Placenta abruptio refers to a normal placenta that separates prior
to fetal delivery. This condition is potentially life-threatening to both mother and fetus; immediate hospitalization is indicated.
               </p>
          <p>Prematurity is defined as delivery before the fetus is able to survive without unusual support. Premature infants are placed in incubators. A lack of body fat in the infant leads to difficulty in maintaining a normal body temperature; special heating is provided to offset th<?oxy_delete author="agroff" timestamp="20130909T151153-0400" content="e"?><?oxy_insert_start author="agroff" timestamp="20130909T151154-0400"?>is<?oxy_insert_end?> problem. Lung immaturity may require mechanical assistance from a respirator. An immature <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2077">immune system</xref> makes <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2731">premature</xref> infants especially susceptible to infections; strict isolation precautions and prophylactic <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1126">antibiotic</xref> therapy address this problem.</p>
          <p>Many factors contribute to increasing the risks normally associated with pregnancy and delivery: maternal size and age; drug, tobacco, or <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1056">alcohol</xref> use; infection; medical conditions such as <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1562">diabetes mellitus</xref> and hypertension; and multiple gestations. A woman with a small pelvic opening may be unable to deliver her child normally; the solution in this case is a cesarean section. The risk of genetic abnormalities increases with advancing maternal (and, to a lesser degree, paternal) age. Counseling prior to <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1454">conception</xref> is indicated. Once an older woman becomes pregnant, <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.1087">amniotic fluid</xref> should be obtained to test for genetic abnormalities. The degree of surveillance is dependent on maternal age: The recommended frequency of medical checks increases for older women.</p>
          <p>Alcohol intake during <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2730">pregnancy</xref> can result in an infant who is <?oxy_delete author="agroff" timestamp="20130909T151359-0400" content="both "?>developmentally disabled<?oxy_delete author="agroff" timestamp="20130909T151402-0400" content=" and mentally retarded"?>; smoking during pregnancy frequently leads to an infant with a <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

          <p>Management of a pregnancy requires specialized skills. As the number of <xref ref-type="glossary" id="mmg06.gloss.2887">risk factors</xref> related to either mother or fetus increases, the problems associated with pregnancy also increase. The care of a pregnant woman and her fetus requires input from many individuals with specialized training. Consequently, perinatology is very much a team effort. Together, the team members can ensure a safe journey through the perinatal period for a pregnant woman and a healthy transition to life outside the womb for a newborn infant.
