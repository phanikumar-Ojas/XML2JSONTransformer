President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and his government were forced to resign, and he fled while still maintaining that he held legitimate power as president. The Houthis, allied with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh (also spelled Salih), then put an interim government in place in Sanaa, opposed by Hadi's government based first in Aden and then in exile. The power struggle turned into outright war when Saudi Arabia led a military coalition of other Arab states in an effort to restore Hadi to power. The civil war caused a major humanitarian crisis, with widespread famine due to halted food imports. In April 2019, Yemen's parliament met in Seiyoun to elect a speaker and vice speakers for the first time since conflict broke out. In November 2019 Hadi's government signed an agreement with the Southern Transition Council to end fighting that had broken out between the two groups earlier in the year, but fighting continued into 2022. The UN was able to negotiate a ceasefire agreement later that year."
