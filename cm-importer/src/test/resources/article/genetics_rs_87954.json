It is this region that gives siRNA its target specificity and allows RISC to bind, leading to target cleavage or repression. While the seed region is important in target recognition, complementarity in other regions is critical for target cleavage. "

When this type of RNA binds to an mRNA, it effectively blocks translation of the mRNA and can therefore be described as having an antisense action—that is, it blocks the expression of the message in the mRNA. Antisense RNA was discovered in 1981 as a mechanism regulating copy number of bacterial plasmids. Some RNAs, such as small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs (snRNA and snoRNA), splice and edit other RNAs, guided by complementary base pairing."
