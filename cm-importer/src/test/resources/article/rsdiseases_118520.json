He even tried to measure them-in 1852, his calculations were refined by German scientist Karl Vierordt. Leeuwenhoek was able to study the path of red blood cells in tadpoles, frogs, and other animals and determined that, without doubt, blood traveled in an entirely closed circle, proving Harvey's contention. Soon, in 1669, English doctor Richard Lower noted that blood coming through arteries was red and that blood flowing toward the heart in veins was bluish."

Then Felix Hoppe-Seyler purified it, studied it, and named it hemoglobin (“blood protein”). The secrets of this precious commodity continued to unfold. In 1747, Italian chemist Vincenzo Antonio Menghini found that there was a small quantity of iron in blood, apparently stored in red blood cells."

Sometimes the operation helped, but occasionally people died after such a transfusion, so doctors largely abandoned the practice. Then, in 1818, James Blundell, an English physician who theorized that the blood of a particular kind of animal would help only that particular kind, transfused blood from healthy human beings to other human beings who needed blood. While often successful, the procedure sometimes caused agglutination, a process in which red blood cells clumped together and would not function properly."

To hasten its identification, scientists have developed the technique of “pooling” by combining blood known to contain infected cells with samples of blood with uninfected normal lymphocytes in an effort to stimulate HIV replication and make the HIV come to light faster. It has been found that the most reliable mix is a pool of fifty donors. The concept of pooling is scientifically valid and economically feasible."

The cells, instead of being joined together as in solid bodily tissues, are suspended in a fluid called plasma, which comprises more than half of blood composition. The cellular portion of blood is largely red blood cells, with smaller numbers of white blood cells and platelets also present. Blood itself is the final functioning tool of the circulatory system, which helps to transport the blood to where it is needed in the body. Blood is an extremely complicated substance, and more things are being learned about it every year."
