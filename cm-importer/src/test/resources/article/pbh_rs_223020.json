Enduring love seeks a long-term relationship, while short-term lust wants to take a chance on the fantasy of Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome. Lusty best-selling books—Harlequin romances, for example—sell in the millions. “The male protagonists are invariably studs on steeds who morph into devoted dads by novel’s end. That is, the women get the best of both worlds,” writes Pelusi (2009). The fantasy world of the novel stokes the hope that the rough edge of the bad boy exists side-by side with tempting, redeeming innocence. A good girl more often than not gets into such a relationship after hearing of a bad boy’s heartrending childhood laced with drugs and sexual abuse at the hands of relatives. A Christian sense of redemption often runs through such narratives. The bad boy has a way of telling his story to many potential bed partners, in quick succession, and then casting himself as a victim when relationships crumble."

Why are bad boys seen as a good choice (at least in the short term) by so many women? Nando Pelusi writes in Psychology Today (2009) that “evolutionary psychologists define ‘good genes’ for men as high-testosterone-fueled masculinity, symmetry, height, and, believe it or not, parasite resistance. Men who are blessed with these qualities tend to be confident and dominant, and able to get away with roguish behavior.” In an earlier time, the fighting skills, risk-taking, and drive of the “bad boy” may have provided a survival advantage, although such men may also have been more prone to injury or death in fights and accidents."
