The situation was an intimate one, with the dining audience seated at tables on three sides of the hall and the play taking place in the center of the floor, down the length of the hall, with entrances through the two doors in the screen at the end opposite the high table (possibly raised) where sat the host with his chief guests. The play took place, therefore, in the midst of the audience, and Medwall shows his genius in adapting and exploiting this close relationship to manipulate the relationship between reality and illusion and to provide humor."

Lucres, daughter of the Roman senator Fulgens, is sought in marriage by Cornelius Flavius, a dissolute aristocrat, and Gayus Flaminius, a virtuous commoner. Her father leaves the choice to her, and she urges the suitors to plead their respective cases in a debate, intending to choose the suitor who proves himself more noble. In the source, this debate takes place before the senate, and no decision is rendered, though the outcome points to Gayus. Limitations of cast size and considerations of dramatic interest and focus led Medwall to have Lucres herself be the audience and judge of the debaters, thus providing English drama with its first heroine. Her decision in favor of Gayus is announced in the play."

							"text": "The play considers a moral question: the source of true nobility. This was a particularly topical matter because Henry VII’s government restrained the power of the old nobility and promoted accomplished commoners, such as Morton, to high office. The emergence of this new class encouraged a strong interest in Humanism, which emphasized innate virtue. Because Medwall’s audience must have included both old and new nobility, he took pains to avoid offending either. He distanced the argument by setting it in ancient Rome, and the brunt of his criticism is directed not at Cornelius’s inherited nobility but at his abuse of it by indulgence in ostentation and pride, theft, murder, riot, and sloth. Lucres makes it clear that honor with inherited nobility is preferable to honor without it, but when the ideal is unavailable, as in this case, honorable poverty is preferable to dishonorable nobility. Her insistence that her decision applies to her case alone and is not to be taken as a general rule provides a critically neutral setting for exploring the question. Finally, that A and B disagree with her conclusion admits the possibility of disagreement, although Medwall has steered the audience toward agreeing with Lucres by characterizing her as intelligent and virtuous and placing the opposite opinion in the mouths of A and B, who are scurrilous rogues without honor or nobility."

Whether More’s antics inspired in Medwall the idea for A and B or whether More may even have played one of them is unknown. In any event, their shifting character and status allow Medwall to control the audience.

This they proceed to do in a song contest, a wrestling match, and a mock tournament, which seems to involve beating buttocks with blunt spears (perhaps mops or brooms), with the competitors’ hands tied. Joan, comically apostrophized as “flower of the frying pan,” is the “lady” honored by the joust. Like Lucres, she exercises control over the two suitors, eventually rejecting both.

When the play resumes, it is evidently still the same day, for A refers to the earlier part as taking place “today.” Medwall builds this social requirement into the structure of the play by applying the break to the suitors’ needs as well: They need time to prepare their speeches. The play is given a natural time scheme: Lucres has appointed the suitors “to be here/ Sone, in the evynyng aboute suppere” to receive her decision."

Cornelius is undercut in that his message to Lucres is given bawdy signification by B’s mistaking of words. Gayus, on the other hand, is portrayed as modest and direct, kind and considerate. In the debate, Cornelius offers Lucres a life of idleness. Gayus’s speech expresses his piety and his military and political activity, and he promises Lucres moderate but sufficient wealth and harmony of disposition. The characters’ relationships are subtly demonstrated: Cornelius appeals to Lucres’ father, and he later approaches her indirectly again in the courtly form of wooing with mummers. Gayus, on the other hand, has a sensitive scene with Lucres herself early in the play and expresses his love to her directly."

It is not known whether this troupe of actors, or the dancers, were permanently attached to Morton’s household. The musicians probably were members of the household. Costume, judging from the description of Cornelius’s elaborate clothing and the engraving of a well-dressed medieval man and woman that Rastell selected for the title page, was contemporary and, along with the jokes, the place references, and the characters of A and B, would have added topicality to the moral. The dominant verse form is rhyme royal, but there is a colloquial fluency in the comic sections achieved through the rhythm, the division of stanzas between speakers, and the use of slang and colloquial expressions. It has been suggested that because there is a Spanish dance and a line of Flemish in the mumming section, the play was written in 1497 to honor a visit of the Spanish and Flemish ambassadors, but this is very tenuous, and the tone is better suited to a less formal occasion. There is no evidence permitting closer dating."

Medwall innovatively conceives of the relationship of Man to his attendant virtues and vices as that of a ruler in relation to his courtiers. He uses a political metaphor to symbolize the human state as the Virtues and Vices offer themselves as attendants to Man sitting on his throne."

Sumptuous dress is culpable not only because it indicates personal vanity and addiction to changing foreign fashion but also because it supports the exploitation of the poor. As with Cornelius, it signifies poor stewardship of worldly goods. Medwall thus expresses support for Henry VII’s policies against livery and maintenance and in favor of fiscal moderation."

The characterization of the Vices, especially in the second half, provides diversion as well as the chief dramatic interest. They muster troops for a battle against Reason.
