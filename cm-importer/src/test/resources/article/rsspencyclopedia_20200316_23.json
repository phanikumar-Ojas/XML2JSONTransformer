Driven by mounting pressure from other emergent professional hockey leagues and the need for a new television contract, the NHL opted to launch an expansion project in 1965 that would ultimately result in the addition of another six teams by the start of the 1967-68 season. Among those applying for a new NHL franchise was a group from Philadelphia led by then-Philadelphia Eagles vice president Ed Snider. With Snider at the helm, the Philadelphia group successfully secured one of the new franchises for its city. They eventually settled on the name Flyers after a city-wide naming-contest. With that, the Philadelphia Flyers officially joined the NHL alongside the newly formed Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Oakland Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins, and St. Louis Blues in 1967."

By the end of their first season, the Flyers finished atop the all-expansion team Western Division and secured the first playoff berth in franchise history.

Two of the key reasons for this turnaround were the hiring new head coach Fred Shero in 1971 and the earlier arrival of charismatic captain Bobby Clarke. With Shero’s guidance from the bench and Clarke’s on-ice leadership, the team gradually found success, notably finishing in second place and winning a playoff series for the first time in the 1972–1973 season. Around the same time, the Flyers also began to adopt a particularly hard-hitting, brawling style of play that transformed them into one of the NHL’s most intimidating teams and led them to become known as the Broad Street Bullies. Coming off a strong 50–16–12 regular season performance, the Flyers entered the 1973–1974 postseason and fought their way to a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins. After a back-and-forth series, the Flyers ultimately defeated the Bruins 1-0 in Game 6 to win their first Stanley Cup championship in front of their hometown fans at the Spectrum. The following year, they repeated this remarkable feat to win a second straight Stanley Cup championship by thwarting the Buffalo Sabres with another Game 6 victory."

Despite a strong performance up to that point, the Flyers were ultimately swept by the overpowering Red Wings. As injuries and off-ice issues took a toll on Lindros’s relationship with the front office in the years that followed, the Flyers again began to struggle in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The team eventually returned to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2010 only to lose to the Chicago Blackhawks. Despite some continuing struggles since that time, the Flyers remain a regular contender and a fan-favorite team that is always among the most popular and successful franchises in the NHL."

Equally important to the Flyers’s 1970s success was left winger Dave “the Hammer” Schultz, whose rough and tumble style was at the center of the team’s notoriously violent reputation. Another of the Flyers’s most intense personalities was Ron Hextall, a fiery goaltender who led the team through its 1987 playoff run and would ultimately earn recognition as one of the franchise’s all-time great netminders. Also key to the team’s 1980s success was longtime captain Dave Poulin, who played eight seasons with the Flyers and recorded 161 goals and 233 assists during his time in Philadelphia. One of Hextall and Poulin’s most prolific teammates was right winger Brian Propp, who recorded a total of 369 goals and 480 assists during his eleven seasons with the Flyers. In the 1990s, left winger John LeClair joined Eric Lindros and right winger Mikael Renberg to form the dominant Legion of Doom line. Other notable Flyers include defensemen brothers Joe and Jimmy Watson, defenseman Ed Van Impe, right winger Reggie Leach, defenseman Barry Ashbee, goaltender Pelle Lindbergh, center and right winger Tim Kerr, defenseman Eric Desjardins, center Rod Brind’Amour, left winger Simon Gagne, center Daniel Briere, center and right winger Claude Giroux, right winger Jakub Voracek, and goaltender Carter Hart."
