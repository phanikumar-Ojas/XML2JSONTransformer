							"text": "English rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. George Harold Harrison was born in Liverpool, England, on February 25, 1943. At an early age, he exhibited a keen interest in popular music, and soon he began to study guitar. At the Liverpool Institute for Boys, he met Paul McCartney, a student who shared his passionate interest in rock and roll. At McCartney’s insistence, Harrison was invited to join the Quarrymen, a musical group led by John Lennon. This group later evolved into the Beatles, and it achieved global success in the 1960’s. In the group, Harrison was lead guitarist and occasional vocalist. Soon he developed a distinctive compositional style informed by his burgeoning interest in the music of India. He later collaborated with diverse artists such as Delaney and Bonnie, the Band, and Bob Dylan, and he also experimented with electronic music. By the time the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Harrison was widely recognized as a composer and musician of the first rank."
