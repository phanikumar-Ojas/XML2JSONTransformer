Recent criticism, however, tends to distinguish the Beat poets from the poets of the San Francisco Renaissance while still acknowledging their many similarities. Commentators often note that these renaissance writers were frequently influenced by San Francisco's specific history of cultural diversity, political activism, and relative acceptance of varied lifestyles and sexual orientations. During World War II, many conscientious objectors had been sent to work at public service camps in lieu of military service. One such camp, Camp Angel near Waldport, Oregon, was dedicated to housing residents with strong artistic interests. After the war, many former inmates chose to move to the San Francisco area, where they contributed to that city's growing reputation as an urban area more culturally diverse, more politically liberal, and more philosophically tolerant than many other American cities of the era."

They favored writing that was spontaneous, immediate, uninhibited, edgy, sexual, potentially offensive, and often politically, socially, and culturally radical. Where Eliot identified with what he called Anglo-Catholicism, the San Francisco writers and the Beats were often either areligious, irreligious, antireligious, or open to a wide variety of non-Western religious influences, especially Buddhism and Hinduism. Whereas Eliot had by the 1950s become a figure associated with the establishment, the San Francisco poets often wrote in ways that seemed deliberately designed to challenge, shock, and even offend establishment sensibilities, especially in matters of sexual language in general and allusions to homosexuality in particular. And while most of Eliot's champions were by that time university professors, most of the San Francisco and Beat writers were cultural bohemians, living in near-poverty and interested in writing poetry that seemed non- or even antiacademic. Their poetry often resembled jazz, designed to be declaimed publicly rather than confined to the printed page, and was often performed aloud with jazz in the background. The San Francisco poets were frequently influenced by the great Romantics, such as William Blake and Percy Bysshe Shelley, as well as by the humanist work of Walt Whitman. Their writings could sometimes seem surrealistic in form and style, unpredictable in design and phrasing, but remained strongly rooted in the everyday facts of common life. Some of the San Francisco writers were particularly interested in preserving the environment, challenging the power of the government, questioning standard American middle-class values, experimenting with mind-altering drugs, and dissenting from American expansionism. Their typically left-wing views put them at odds with much of the rest of American society during the 1950s, a period of strong, sometimes intolerant anticommunism."

According to Linda Hamalian, Rexroth \u0022thought that William Butler Yeats and T. S. Eliot were socially ineffective even though their poetry was 'truly revolutionary in its final implications.' In Rexroth's estimation, Yeats and Eliot had evolved for themselves, not necessarily anyone else, systems of theosophy and Anglo-Catholicism deeply critical of middle class values also held in contempt by Rexroth\u0022 (\u0022Re-discovering Community\u0022). Either way, \u0022Codicil,\u0022 in its simplicity, clarity, forthrightness, and forceful expression of undisguised personal opinion, represents many of the aesthetic values and literary traits prized by Rexroth and his younger friends."

The phrase \u0022music of myself\u0022 could easily have come from Whitman, and the emphasis on a deeply personal vision could similarly have come from Blake. And if the reference to \u0022Circe-Voices\u0022 might disturb some academic readers who know their Greek mythology (where Circe is a goddess or witch who lures men to self-destruction), there is no hint of the risks of drug use in these lines by McClure."

They had much in common with the Beat poets of the same period, and in fact many of the same people participated in both movements. Recent criticism, however, tends to distinguish the Beat poets from the poets of the San Francisco Renaissance while still acknowledging their many similarities. Commentators often note that these renaissance writers were frequently influenced by San Francisco's specific history of cultural diversity, political activism, and relative acceptance of varied lifestyles and sexual orientations. During World War II, many conscientious objectors had been sent to work at public service camps in lieu of military service. One such camp, Camp Angel near Waldport, Oregon, was dedicated to housing residents with strong artistic interests. After the war, many former inmates chose to move to the San Francisco area, where they contributed to that city's growing reputation as an urban area more culturally diverse, more politically liberal, and more philosophically tolerant than many other American cities of the era."
