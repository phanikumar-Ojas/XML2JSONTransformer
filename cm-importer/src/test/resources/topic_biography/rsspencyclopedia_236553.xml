						               </bold>, which is the Japanese word describing a fanaticism for anime and cartoons. His work also contrasts Japanese and American cultures. Murakami’s art quickly became known for its glossy, bright colors and youthful quality.</p>
               <p>The artist worked in New York in 1995 when he was awarded an Asian Cultural Fellowship. He said he liked working in the United States because it was possible to achieve one’s vision, and when one succeeded, Americans were quick to give an individual credit for the work and achievement. He became a visiting professor at the School of the Art and Architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1998.</p>
               <p>Murakami’s first public exhibition was also in 1998. <bold>

               <title>Life's Work</title>
               <p>In 1996, the artist founded the Hiropon Factory, which eventually evolved to become the Kaikai Kiki Co. Ltd. The company both develops art and manages artists. Murakami unveiled his sculpture <bold>
                        <italic>Miss</italic>
						               </bold>
						               <bold>
                        <italic>Ko2</italic>
						               </bold>, an anime-inspired character, in 1997. <bold>
                        <italic>Miss Ko2</italic>
						               </bold>, pronounced "Miss KoKo, is a highly sexualized figure with long legs and full breasts. She is wearing a waitress’s uniform. The artist produced a number of versions of his female anime figures in various color schemes.</p>
               <p>Murakami drew a great deal of attention and controversy for sculptures he debuted in quick succession. <bold>
                        <italic>Hiropon</italic>
						               </bold> (1997) consists of three similar sculptures depicting an anime-inspired woman in a tiny bikini with milk gushing from her huge breasts. He followed this a year later with the sculpture <bold>
                        <italic>My Lonesome Cowboy</italic>
						               </bold> (1998), which is a nude male figure enclosed in a swirling stream of semen.</p>
               <p>In 2000 Murakami founded a movement known as superflat, a 2-D style that does not adhere to reality. Superflat is influenced by a variety of styles, including graphic design, Japanese manga comics, and traditional Japanese prints and screen paintings. During the same year, Murakami also created <bold>
                        <italic>Cosmos Ball,</italic>
						               </bold> which embodies his signature cheerful style. Many of the artist’s most readily recognized work features grinning flowers and mushrooms, among other <bold>
                        <italic>kawaii</italic>
						               </bold> (cute) characters.</p>
               <p>Murakami began a working partnership with fashion designer Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton in 2003. Murakami redesigned the Louis Vuitton logo and the fashion label's handbags. The Louis Vuitton Multicolore project was wildly successful. Murakami’s career was celebrated in Los Angeles in 2007 at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The retrospective was titled "© Murakami."</p>
               <p>Murakami also had a solo exhibition at Château de Versailles in 2010, achieving the distinction of being the third contemporary artist to do so. Though he was well-known internationally, he said he felt that he was influential rather than important in his home country. He advocated looking to the past and exploring one’s culture to advance one’s art.</p>
               <p>At various times, Murakami spoke to groups and became a radio personality. Though he had tried earlier in his career to create a narrative, he had given up on the effort for some time. He returned to the idea, however, in 2013. He created a film, <bold>
                        <italic>Jellyfish Eyes</italic>
						               </bold>, a story about children and their magical friends, who turn out to be something other than what they seem to be. The creatures are reminiscent of Murakami’s art.</p>
               <p>In late 2015 and early 2016 Murakami’s work was exhibited in Tokyo for the first time in fourteen years. Murakami employed a number of apprentices to create the work, which was inspired by the devastation in Japan following an earthquake that caused a tsunami. He created the massive painting to thank the State of Qatar for assisting his country in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster. <bold>
                        <italic>The 500</italic>

                        <italic>Arhats</italic>
						               </bold> drew more than three hundred thousand visitors over its four-month run. His Kaikai Kiki company organized the installation. Murakami also exhibited his work in early 2016 at the Yokohama Museum of Art. Yet, despite the crowds the exhibit drew, Murakami said the Japanese did not understand his work.</p>
               <p>Murakami opened a number of venues in the Nakano district of Tokyo in the Nakano Broadway shopping center. The café bar and galleries bore the name Zingaro. The area was known for its manga shops and other attractions that appealed to what Murakami called the geeks, including toy shops and video game stores.</p>
               <p>Murakami's art is in the permanent collections of many museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.</p>

               <title>Impact</title>
               <p>Murakami’s bright, cheerful work has a futuristic feel. He has been described as the Japanese Andy Warhol. His work bridges the gap between art and pop culture, making the work accessible. His efforts to commercialize his characters brought his creations to a wider fan base. He has commercialized his work to sell a variety of merchandise, in particular items featuring his character Mr. Dob.</p>
