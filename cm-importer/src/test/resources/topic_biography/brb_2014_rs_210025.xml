               <p>During the early years of Dale’s acting career, television was an emerging medium. His first television role was on a New Zealand series called <italic>Radio Waves</italic>. In the late 1970s, Dale’s work on <italic>Radio Waves</italic> and his theatrical performances helped him land a television job in Australia, where he appeared on the television show <italic>The Young Doctors</italic>. Although he applied to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, Australia, in his early thirties, he was denied entry. Nevertheless, Dale persevered, earning a role on the Australian soap opera <italic>Neighbours</italic> in 1985. Dale continued to play the role of Jim Robinson on the soap opera until 1993. His work on <italic>Neighbours</italic> made him a familiar face to television audiences in New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. However, the popularity of the character made it difficult for him to find additional acting work after leaving the show.</p>

               <title>Revitalized Career</title>
               <p>Following his work in <italic>Neighbours</italic>, Dale worked as a voiceover artist but struggled finding other acting roles. He became involved in several business ventures, including a children’s magazine, but none of them proved successful. In 2000, Dale moved his family to Los Angeles, where he began taking acting classes. Given that he was in his early fifties, Dale understood that his odds of revitalizing his career as a working actor were low, but he continued to pursue his craft.</p>
               <p>After appearing in the television movies <italic>Alien Cargo</italic> and <italic>First Daughter</italic> in 1999, Dale earned a recurring role in the television series <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

Through hard work and determination, he experienced a career renaissance throughout the 2000s, earning roles on such popular television series as <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The series was awarded a Golden Globe for best television series in the musical or comedy category in 2007.</p>
               <p>From 2006 to 2010, Dale appeared as Charles Widmore in the popular television series <italic>Lost</italic>. He appeared as John Ellis in the HBO television series <italic>Entourage</italic> from 2008 to 2011 and as Lloyd Alan Philips Jr. in the Showtime series <italic>Californication</italic> in 2011. From 2003 to 2013, Dale played the role of Tom Morrow in <italic>NCIS</italic>. His success on American television helped him earn film roles through the 2000s and 2010s, appearing in films such as <italic>Star Trek: Nemesis</italic> (2002), <italic>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</italic> (2008), <italic>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</italic> (2011), and <italic>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</italic> (2014).</p>
               <p>Beyond his work as a television and film actor, Dale has lent his voice to several video game titles, including<italic> X-Men: Next Dimension</italic> (2002), <italic>24: The Game</italic> (2006), <italic>Mass Effect 3</italic> (2013), and <italic>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</italic> (2013).

               <title>Impact</title>
               <p>Despite his inauspicious beginnings in New Zealand theater, Dale has leveraged his late-career success to become one of the most widely recognized television actors in the entertainment industry. The length of Dale’s acting career and the variety of roles he has inhabited led Ben Rawson-Jones of <italic>Digital Spy</italic> to described him as an "institution" in 2009.</p>
