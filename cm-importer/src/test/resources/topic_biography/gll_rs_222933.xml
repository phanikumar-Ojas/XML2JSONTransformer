          <p>Rivera’s mother enrolled her in the Jones Haywood School of Ballet with the hope that she would learn discipline and poise. She was allowed to take classes three times a week. Doris Jones and Claire Haywood founded their school of dance expressly to serve minority children because they believed all children deserved the opportunity to benefit from classical dance instruction. Rivera always expressed appreciation to Jones and Haywood.</p>
          <p>In 1950, a teacher from George Balanchine’s School of American Ballet in New York visited the Jones Haywood studio. Fifteen-year-old Rivera was one of two students selected to audition for <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In an action that has become legendary, Balanchine realized that the determined young ballerina was dancing even though her foot was bleeding through her toe shoe. He stopped the audition to bandage her foot himself. Rivera was accepted to Balanchine’s School of American Ballet and given a scholarship, making it possible for her to study with such major twentieth-century American ballet dancers as Allegra Kent, Edward Villella, and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

She won the part, beating out her friend. This marked the end of her ballet aspirations and the beginning of her musical theater career. Rivera made her Broadway debut in 1950 as a dancer in the musical <italic>Guys and Dolls</italic>. In 1952, she danced in <italic>Call Me Madam</italic>, and in 1953, in <italic>Can-Can</italic>.

She starred as Rosie Alvarez in <italic>Bye Bye Birdie</italic> on Broadway in 1960 and in the London production the following year. She played Anyanka in the play <italic>Bajour</italic> from 1964 to 1965. Rivera and Mordente were divorced in 1966.
