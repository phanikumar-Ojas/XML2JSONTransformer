               <p>Painter. Thomas Cole was born on February 1, 1801, in Bolton-le-Moors, England. As a child, he worked as an engraver's assistant and was also an apprentice to a designer of calico prints. His family immigrated to the United States in 1818, and Cole continued his work assisting engraver's in Philadelphia before moving to Steubenville, Ohio, in 1819. In Ohio, Cole began studying oil painting and learned techniques from a local portrait painter. He continued to develop his talent over the next few years. He mainly chose nature as his subject, painting intricate and expressive images of items such as trees and branches. In 1823, he began studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, working a number of jobs in the art business to finance his schooling.</p>

                     <bold>Significance:</bold> Thomas Cole was an English American landscape painter. His work often featured scenes from the Hudson River Valley, especially the Catskill Mountains. Cole had many patrons throughout his career. In his later years, he gave his work a storytelling quality and began inserting religious and literary elements into his art. Cole's landscape works of art had a major impact on the course of American landscape painting, and he is credited with inspiring the Hudson River School art movement of the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

               <p>Two years later, Cole moved to New York City with his family. He made a point to visit the state's many natural wonders, traveling up the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

He painted numerous landscape portraits of the Catskills, several of which were sold to prominent American art collectors. Cole's talent and reputation earned him a place as a founding member of the National Academy of Design in 1826. Demand for his paintings continued to grow throughout the 1820s, and some of his more famous early creations include 1827's <italic>The Last of the Mohicans,</italic> which depicts a scene from the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>Cole's American scenery commissions were plentiful during this period, but the artist sought to give his paintings a new quality that evoked religious and moral meaning. He was not satisfied with his initial attempts, so he traveled to Europe to study the works of old masters. He made friends with fellow artists Joseph Mallord William Turner and <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In Italy, he came up with an idea for a series of landscape paintings depicting the rise and fall of civilization. After returning to America in 1832, he presented his idea to New York merchant <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The works earned him much acclaim and a good deal of attention within the American art world.</p>

               <title>Life's Work</title>
               <p>The late 1830s and 1840s saw Cole giving his work a more narrative purpose. His landscapes featured elaborate renderings of ancient and medieval scenery as well as depictions of biblical and literary scenes. His 1837 paintings <italic>The Departure</italic> and <italic>The Return</italic> tell a story of a group of knights, led by their lively lord, leaving on a heroic crusade only to return drained and defeated as they carry their dying lord home. Cole's work also took on a distinctive religious and philosophical tone. His <italic>The Voyage of Life</italic> series consisted of paintings portraying the four stages of human life: <italic>Childhood</italic>, <italic>Youth</italic>, <italic>Manhood</italic>, and <italic>Old Age</italic>. Throughout his life, Cole also penned a number of essays and poems. In 1836, he published his "Essay on American Scenery," which detailed his views regarding landscape art. He continued to produce varied scenery of the American landscape during this period, and was particularly fond of portraying his beloved Catskill Mountains.</p>
               <p>Cole embarked on his second trip overseas in 1841, again spending much of his time in Italy and visiting Sicily. He returned to America a year later and began work on a number of foreign and American landscape paintings. These works displayed an observable change in the way Cole depicted atmosphere and light. He improved the accuracy of these elements, giving his work an even more majestic appearance. In 1844, Cole accepted a pupil named Frederic Church into his studio in Catskill, New York. Church studied with Cole for two years and later became a prominent member of the <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>Cole used his newly polished technique to create a series of paintings aimed at portraying the quest for spiritual wisdom and redemption. This series was originally meant to be a collection of five paintings called<italic> The Cross and the World</italic>, but Cole never completed the series. Cole contracted pleurisy in 1848 and passed away on February 11, 1848, in Catskill, New York.</p>
