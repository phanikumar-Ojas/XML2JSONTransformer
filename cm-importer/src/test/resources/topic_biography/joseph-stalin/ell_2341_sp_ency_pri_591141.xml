               <title>The Russian Revolution</title>
               <p>Joseph Stalin was born in Georgia, a part of Russia, in 1879. He was a <bold>radical.</bold> A radical is a person who wants to make huge changes in the government and the world. Stalin learned about a way of living called <bold>communism</bold>. In communism, the community owns everything. Individual people do not own <bold>property</bold>, or things like houses and land.</p>
               <p>The <bold>Russian Revolution</bold> began in 1917. A revolution is a war that begins inside a country, and that makes big changes in the government and daily life. Communists took over Russia's government during the Russian Revolution. They formed a new country called the <bold>Soviet Union.</bold>
                  </p>
               <p>Stalin was part of the Russian Revolution. He helped start the new government, too. He became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1929. As the leader, Stalin worked to change the <bold>economy</bold> of the Soviet Union. The economy is a system that helps a country to make, buy, and sell things. Stalin built many new factories in the new Soviet Union.</p>

               <title>Hunger and Fear</title>
               <p>But Stalin was not a kind leader. He did many things that hurt people. Under Stalin's leadership, the communist government took farmland for the government. Farmers did not own their land or the things they grew on the land. When Stalin changed the way people farmed the land, there was not enough food for everyone. Millions of people died of hunger. But Stalin did not change his way of thinking.</p>
               <p>Stalin was cruel in other ways, too. He often sent people to prison if he disagreed with them. Sometimes he had them killed. Many of these prisons were far away. They were called <bold>gulags.</bold> Life there was very, very difficult. Many people died in the gulags.</p>

               <title>World War II and the Cold War</title>
               <p>World War II began in 1939. Stalin joined with England, France, and the United States. These countries all worked together to <bold>defeat</bold> the Nazis and win the war.</p>
               <p>The Nazis were a political group in Germany. Adolf Hitler was their leader. Hitler was a cruel and <bold>violent</bold> man and he did many horrible things. Hitler might have won the war if Stalin had not joined with the other countries to fight him.</p>
               <p>Stalin was still the leader of the Soviet Union when the <bold>Cold War</bold> between his country and the United States began, soon after World War II. A cold war is a war of ideas. The Cold War was still going on when Stalin died in 1953.</p>
