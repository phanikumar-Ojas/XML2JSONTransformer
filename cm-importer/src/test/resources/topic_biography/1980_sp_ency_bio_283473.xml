               <p>Because of his ability to evolve in both musical style and image, George Michael, born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, became one of the most well-known singer-songwriters of the 1980s. While still a teen, he formed the group Wham! UK with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley, releasing their first album, the rap-inspired <italic>Fantastic</italic>, in 1983. Unhappy with their label and eager to reach a wider audience, the pair shortened their name to Wham!, moved to CBS/Columbia, and cultivated a sunny, clean-cut image for the release of their second album, <italic>Make It Big</italic> (1984). The album yielded several hit singles in Great Britain and the United States, including the jitterbug-style "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and the earnest "Freedom." In 1984 they also released the single "Last Christmas," which would become a staple of holiday radio.<fig fig-type="elec_use" position="margin">

               <p>In 1986, Wham! released its third album, <italic>Music from the Edge of Heaven</italic>, which sold well in Great Britain but not in the United States. Shortly thereafter, they announced the group’s dissolution. Michael, ready to pursue a solo career, again altered his style and image before releasing <italic>Faith</italic>  at the end of 1987. First, however, he recorded the single "I Want Your Sex" for the 1987 film <italic>Beverly Hills Cop II</italic>. Although the controversial song was banned by many radio stations, it became a hit. Michael also recorded a duet with <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

               <p>With all of the hype surrounding these singles, <italic>Faith</italic> had much to live up to, and it did not disappoint. The title song’s video introduced Michael’s sexy new image, complete with leather jacket and facial stubble, while "Father Figure," a slow, sultry tune about forbidden love, was also a hit. <italic>Faith</italic> won the Grammy for Album of the Year, but Michael’s resulting success and exhausting schedule took its toll, and his subsequent albums did not reach the same heights. <italic>Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1</italic> (1990) moved his sound away from the pure pop style that had made him a star, though it still performed well and included the hit single "Praying for Time." In later years, Michael would further renounce his image as a sex symbol, due in part to his discomfort with the pressures of being a superstar as well as the loss of a loved partner. His 1996 album <italic>Older</italic> showcased his pivot to targeting more mature audiences; it was not hugely successful in the United States but spawned multiple hit singles in Great Britain and mainland Europe. Media outlets would later confirm that Michael was the top-played artist on the radio in Britain over the twenty years from 1984 to 2004. His more than 115 million albums sold around the world made him among the best-selling artists of all time.</p>
               <p>Throughout his career Michael became known for his philanthropy almost as much as for his music. In 1984, while still with Wham!, he appeared along with other stars on the benefit single "Do They Know It's Christmas?" released under the Band Aid name in support of relief efforts for the Ethiopian famine. Michael also frequently supported <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

In 1998 he came out as gay following his arrest in California on lewd behavior charges. He would later discuss his struggles with depression and shame in keeping his sexuality secret, and identified himself variously as gay or bisexual.</p>
               <p>Much of Michael's musical output in the twenty-first century came in the form of free downloads, for which he asked fans to donate to charity. His final album of original material was <italic>Patience</italic>, released in 2004. Along with his occasional single releases, he also continued to perform occasionally. His popular legacy meant that many of his shows were sold-out performances in stadium venues, despite his lack of many new songs. In 2011 he was forced to cancel a number of shows after being hospitalized with severe pneumonia; the illness proved life-threatening and he underwent treatment over the course of five weeks, over part of which he was comatose. In 2014 he put out a live album recorded during his 2010-11 world tour, including his own previously-released songs and standards backed by an orchestra.</p>
               <p>On December 25, 2016—Christmas Day—Michael was found unresponsive at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, and pronounced dead at the scene. While the exact cause of death was not immediately identified, it was stated to be natural causes and that Michael died peacefully in his bed. Heart issues were later determined to be behind the death.</p>
