He opened a shop in Milan with forty-two thousand dollars in borrowed capital, thirty-five workers, and some experience in vulcanization, the process whereby rubber is hardened to prevent melting at high temperatures. It was the first business of its kind in Italy and one of the first in Europe.</p>

               <title>Lives’ Work</title>
               <p>The firm developed specialties in wires, insulated cables, and eventually automobile tires. It produced some of the earliest telegraph and telephone wires for Italy’s new army. In 1879, Giovanni extended his enterprise to the production of electrical conductors. He later produced cables whose design and construction stood far in advance of anything obtainable at the time. In 1883, Milan inaugurated the Edison Central Electric Station, the first station of its scale in Europe. The Pirelli firm supplied the rubber-coated wires used in the new installations, its first customer being the Milanese opera house, <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

The company pioneered the manufacture of electric cable and, in 1887, began producing and installing underwater cables as well. The firm had a subsidiary factory in Barcelona for the production of electric cables by 1902, making Pirelli the first Italian industrialist to establish plants outside Italy. In 1917, when a Pirelli engineer patented an oil-insulated cable that could carry far more than the limit then in effect, Pirelli became a leader in the high-tension cable business. The Pirelli firm entered the pneumatic tire business in 1890 with production of its first air-filled bicycle tires. As Italy’s automobile industry began increased development, Pirelli moved into the pneumatic automobile tire market in 1899.

               <p>Giovanni’s son, Piero, joined the firm in 1901. Piero received an LL.D. at the University of Genoa. Alberto, a second son, joined the business in 1903. To promote the automobile tire industry, Alberto helped sponsor the eight-thousand-mile Beijing-to-Paris automobile race of 1907, which was won by the Italian driver Prince Borghese in a car fitted with Pirelli tires.

               <p>By 1914, the Pirelli company was the largest Italian manufacturer of rubber goods.

               <p>The Pirelli family, particularly Alberto, pushed rubber technology to the limit. Besides innovative research and application in the tire industry and with rubber-insulated electric cables, the Pirelli organization has produced countless rubber items, including skin diving equipment, raincoats, elastic thread, plastic food bags, baby bottle nipples, rubber hoses, and drive belts.</p>
